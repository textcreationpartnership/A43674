            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF it ſurprize the Reader to ſee ſo large a Book written againſt Dr. <hi>B.</hi> and Dr. <hi>T.</hi> it will ſurprize him more to tell him, That I could more eaſily have made it larger, than have confined it within this Compaſs. For thoſe Two Gentlemen are not barren Subjects, but furniſh Matter in choice and plenty for Hiſtory againſt themſelves; and though theſe Diſcourſes which I have made upon them are not an <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> yet the Reader will find they are in part <hi>Hiſtorical;</hi> and may, in ſome reſpects, ſerve to inform and entertain inquiſitive Searchers after Truth, till it may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to publiſh a compleat Hiſtory of the Things, which ſome Men have done ſince the late Revolution, in Church and State.</p>
            <p>But beſides the many Paſſages of Story, which the Reader will meet with in the following Treatiſe, he will alſo find I have had occaſions to make ſeveral incidental Diſcourſes; ſome <hi>Theological,</hi> ſome <hi>Moral,</hi> and ſome of a <hi>Political Nature,</hi> to confute or expoſe the looſe Doctrines, or Expreſſions of thoſe Men; againſt whom, as I have been provoked to draw up Two ſeveral Charges, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, which ſomewhat blemiſh their Honour; ſo I hope I have proved them in every Part by very good Evidence. And as ſome Tryals are longer than others, according to the Number and Length of Depoſitions; ſo if this Book of mine, which contains as it were ſo many Depoſitions againſt them, hath proved longer than I would have had it, that is none of my Fault.</p>
            <p>I know very well it will be called a <hi>Libel,</hi> and a <hi>Defamatory Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> but I care not for that; ſince many excellent Books were ſo miſcalled in the Times of former Uſurpations, which detected the ill Men of thoſe Times, and their Hypocriſies and Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the World. And beſides, to ſpeak properly and juſtly of the Nature of a <hi>Libel,</hi> all Books ought not to be ſo called, which expoſe Men's Reputations; but ſuch only as expoſe them falſely, injuriouſly, and out of pure malice: But this Book, though in ſome Things it blemiſhes the Fame and Reputation of theſe Men,
<pb facs="tcp:62198:3"/> yet it doth it truly, juſtly, and deſervedly; and ſo far am I from bearing the Perſon of the one, or the Memory of the other any Malice, That had I been acted by that evil Paſſion, I could have written againſt them both much ſooner, and have been better provided to write againſt them now. Men that do ill Things openly, and with an high Hand, though under never ſo ſplendid Pretences, ought to hear of them; eſpecially when they go about to make <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Heroes</hi> of one another, with a Deſign to cover their own Iniquities, and deceive the People. When this happens to be the Caſe, Charity to the Peoples Souls, and the Love of the Publick, obliges all Lovers of Truth and Righteouſneſs to unvizard ſuch Men, and expoſe them in their true Appearance before their credulous and deluded Admirers. And as I have endeavoured in the following Diſcourſes to do ſo, by theſe two popular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; ſo I aſſu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the Reader I have done it purely upon theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Motives, wiſhing, with all my Heart, That neither of them had given ſo many and publick Provocations to undeceive any part of the World, by writing ſuch ſevere Truths.</p>
            <p>I foreſee very well what Sorts of Men will ſet themſelves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt it, and how it will ruffle our Funeral Orator, and raiſe a Storm among the Men of <hi>his Latitude;</hi> but I am not ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about the Entertainment it will meet with among them, in hopes it will do good among ſome that are misled by them, if they are not too far gone, and hinder others, both now and hereafter, from being misled by that Sort of Men. For I have written it not only for the Times preſent, but for Poſterity, and future Times; when I doubt not but Books, which do leſs good now, ſhall then do much more; when <hi>Libels</hi> ſo miſcalled ſhall be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſought after, and reprinted in greater Numbers; and then inform the penitent World, not only what unrighteous Things have then been lately acted among us, but by what unrighteous Men, and upon what unrighteous Principles they alſo have been done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Remarks on the late Funeral Sermons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Letter to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Funeral Sermon at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>Abby: Theſe Diſcourſes,</hi> not to mention others long ſince Printed, will let Poſterity ſee what kind of Men our <hi>Preacher,</hi> and his <hi>Heroe,</hi> and his <hi>Hero</hi>'s <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> not to mention others, were; and what pernicious Doctrines were vented by them all, and ſo help to convert the Lovers of Truth, as thoſe called <hi>Libels</hi> in former Times converted many,
<pb facs="tcp:62198:3"/> and helped to bring the Nation to its Wits; and the exil'd King back to his Throne.</p>
            <p>I could name ſeveral of my Acquaintance who were converted by the <hi>Libels</hi> ſo called in the <hi>Long Uſurpation;</hi> one more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, who, by God's Bleſſing, happen'd to be converted by the accidental Reading of one of the meaneſt of them, and Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> which was reckoned a dangerous <hi>Libel:</hi> And if theſe Diſcourſes of mine happen, by God's good Providence, now or hereafter to diſabuſe but one miſtaken Soul, and occaſion his Converſion, I ſhall think all the unwilling Pains I have taken in Writing of them very well beſtowed. I find Mr. <hi>Altham,</hi> in his late Recantation for Licenſing Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>'s Book, ſorrowfully confeſſing, That Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Honour and <hi>Function</hi> were much Blacken'd by it; but if this Book of mine hath alſo Blacken'd his Honour, it hath Blacken'd it with Matters of Truth; and he muſt blame himſelf for it, who hath given ſo many juſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and Provocations to all Sorts of Men to Blacken him in all Places <note n="*" place="margin">See the Character M. L. G. hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of him in the Advertiſement before his Letter to Monſ. Thave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, p. <hi>87, 88.</hi>
               </note> both at home and abroad. But for his Sacred Function, for which I have much more veneration than he hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that cannot ſuffer by what I have ſaid of him, becauſe it will remain Sacred and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, whatever I have proved him to be, nor loſe any more of the reſpect which is due to it, becauſe he is a Biſhop, than human Nature can loſe of the Honour and Dignity which is due to it, becauſe he is a Man. Though Biſhops turn Rebels, and make Rebels and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws Biſhops, yet I muſt reverence the Function, by reaſon I think it of Divine Inſtitution: But notwithſtanding all my Reverence for it, I think it ought not to be a Cover and Protection for ill Men, who pervert whole Nations, and Churches; eſpecially for inſolent and cruel Men, who perſecute their Brethren, for no other Reaſon but becauſe they profeſs and practiſe the ſame Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines which they themſelves formerly taught the People; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have endeavoured to convince the World, by their Books, That theſe Men are Apoſtates, and have done both our Church and Religion much more harm than they can do it good. Theſe are the Traytors to that very Order which ſome of them have Uſurped, and ſeem ready to give up the <hi>uninterrupted Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> upon which the Prieſthood depends, if they may but by gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Sort of Diſſenters better ſecure their Baronies, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
<pb facs="tcp:62198:4"/> which they mind more than the Honour of their Order, or the Catholick Rights of the Church. What elſe means their Courting at ſuch a fulſom Rate thoſe in one Kingdom, who have deſtroyed it in another? Why elſe are they ſo ready to treat it away under a Pretence of <hi>Union</hi> with Diſſenters, and in Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Foreign Churches? Why, contrary to former Times, do they ſuffer ſome <hi>French Miniſters,</hi> who have not had Epiſcopal Ordination, to Preach and Adminiſter the Sacraments at the Church in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and its Dependences, which by the Act of Uniformity is a Member of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> What means this new Diſcovery of Comprehenſion in ſo many of the late <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sermons,</hi> which the Convocation rejected? Why do they exhort Lay-men to ſupport, and Clergy-men to comply with Presbytery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as I have ſhewed our Preacher, and his Heroe did? Or laſtly, What means the new Hypotheſis of <note n="*" place="margin">See the Book of the Revelation paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, with Annotations on each Chapter. Lond. printed by Rich. Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington at the Lute in St. Paul's Churchyard, <hi>1694.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Witneſſing Churches,</hi> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Churches in <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which have no Biſhops, have born their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt Popery, therefore Biſhops by <hi>uninterrupted</hi> Succeſſion, and Prieſts of Epiſcopal Ordination, (which have been the ſignal Bleſſing of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) are not neceſſary to the Church? At the Rate that Annotator writes, in very many Places of his Book and Preface, we muſt blend our pure Orders and Prieſthood, not only with Miniſters who derive their <hi>Miſſion</hi> from Presbyters, but with Miniſters who derive them ultimately from meer Lay-men, as many of the firſt Reformers both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> were. Nay, at this rate of talking, I know not what is neceſſary to Chriſtianity, either as a <hi>Sect</hi> profeſſing Doctrines, or a <hi>Society</hi> which Antiquity, ſo much undervalued by him, called the Catholick Church. For <hi>Anabaptiſts, Quakers</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> have born their Teſtimony againſt Popery, and will bear it; and therefore in his wild way of Writing not only Biſhops but Prieſts, nor Epiſcopal Orders only, but all Orders, with Infant Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, may be parted with, as <hi>Temporary Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> for comprehenſion of all Sects that pretend to be Chriſtian, and witneſſes againſt the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nay, this dangerous Hypotheſis of the witneſſing Churches may, for any Thing I ſee to the contrary, be improved to the Advantage of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to prove them to be the Church of God: For they have born,
<pb facs="tcp:62198:4"/> and will bear their Teſtimony againſt Popery; and great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them have died Martyrs againſt it in the Inquiſition. I need but mention the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who abhor Popery for its Image-Worſhip, and the Invocation of Saints, as much as the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing Churches:</hi> And therefore it is a mad way of arguing to cure us of our <hi>Fondneſs</hi> (as he is pleaſed to call it) for our uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Epiſcopal Succeſſion, becauſe the <hi>Witneſſing Churches</hi> have the Misfortune to want it. This is the Argument of the Fox in the Fable, who had loſt his Tail; and had Men argued in this manner in the Primitive Times, they might have laid aſide both the Sacraments in the Church, becauſe great Numbers of <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> died Martyrs, or Witneſſes, againſt the Idolatry of <hi>Rome</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; which, notwithſtanding all the Comments and Annotations of ſome Men, I believe was much more Abominable than that of the modern Papal <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Annotator I take to be one of thoſe Men who drive on for Comprehenſion; and with thoſe <hi>Latitudinarians</hi> it was, and more particularly Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:62198:5"/> the Power of the Keys, nor to the Divine Authority of the holy Scriptures, which depends ſo much upon <hi>Tradition,</hi> That they themſelves alone are not <hi>alone ſufficient</hi> to prove it without the Teſtimony of the Church.</p>
            <p>It was my Deſign in writing theſe Diſcourſes to aim at all the Men of this <hi>broad Way</hi> of Union, as well as againſt thoſe Two whom I have detected, and thereby to warn the reſt of the Clergy againſt them. For, God be thanked, the main Body of our Clergy are Men of quite different Spirits; they do not perſecute their old Brethren for their ſtrict Doctrines, but pity and help to ſupport them. They know by Experience how hard it was for Conſcience to overcome the Difficulties of the new Oath, and therefore they <note n="*" place="margin">Among the worthy Men I here deſcribe may juſtly be reckoned the late learned Mr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> who put out Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Works. Dr. <hi>Dove,</hi> who, as all the World knows, took the new Oath with ſo much reluctance; and once tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Dr. <hi>B.</hi> out of his Houſe, for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he thought too warmly for the Government. And more particularly Dr. <hi>Scot,</hi> of worthy Memory, who firſt refuſed the Biſhoprick of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not take the Oath of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and afterwards anotther Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, the Deanry of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and a Prebendary of the Church of <hi>Windſor,</hi> becauſe they all were Places of deprived Men; and therefore Dr. <hi>Iſham,</hi> in his Funeral Sermon, did improperly make them <hi>attendants upon the Obſequies of the late bleſſed Queen,</hi> as he is pleaſed to ſay. To theſe may be added the learned Dr. <hi>Busby.</hi> I dare not name the Living.</note> retain vey tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions for thoſe who could not overcome them, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them in their Hearts, as Men of Principles, who are moſt Faithful to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy, Zealous for the Honour and Proſperity of the Royal Family, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrines, and Rights of the Church. Nay, I have Reaſon to hope, that they wait for the <hi>Times of healing and refreſhing,</hi> when they may come again to Communion with them under the <hi>Rightful Biſhops,</hi> who never did betray their Order, or act in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Doctrines of the Church. I know in ſome meaſure what I ſay to be true; and if any Man doubt of it, let him conſider what <hi>Inclinations</hi> the Convocation diſcovered at its firſt Sitting down.</p>
            <p>But theſe Two Men, and the reſt, againſt whom theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are intended, are to be conſidered as Men of quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit: For they revile and perſecute their old Brethren, and ſay all manner of Evil falſely againſt them, for their Principles
<pb facs="tcp:62198:5"/> ſake, and for their adhering to them. If they are to preach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a great Audience, eſpecially upon a ſolemn Occaſion, then they will be ſure to inveigh againſt them, and as they think expoſe them for their <hi>Paucity,</hi> or <hi>want of Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Peeviſhneſs,</hi> or, which is very ſtrange, for being <hi>dangerous to the Goverment,</hi> which it is impoſſible for ſo ſmall a Number of Men to be, unleſs they have Truth on their ſide. I have ſhewed, in ſeveral Inſtances, how this perſecuting Spirit diſcovered it ſelf in theſe Two Men, upon whom I have diſcourſed; and how it poſſeſſeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them may be ſeen in his <note n="(a)" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>I would not have my Reader think that I put this Gloſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Words without Cauſe; for he hath been a Perſecutor of his old Brethren, both by Word and Deed, ever ſince they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived. It was he that egged on Juſtice <hi>Tully,</hi> when Vicar of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> to drive a Meeting of Sufferers out of his Pariſh. I could name the Gentleman that read his Letter to that purpoſe, over the Juſtice's Shoulder, as he ſtood reading it in the Street, and this Spirit of Perſecution in him proceeds from a Spirit of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> which makes him he cannot endure the Men of ſtrict Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Principles; beccauſe they, and their Reaſonings, which he ſeems to undervalue ſo much, but really ſtands in awe of, are contrary to him in all his Deſigns. I ſay, he ſtands in awe of their Reaſonings, and therefore hath taken more Pains than any one Man among them to ſuppreſs them, by hunting out the private Preſſes, and getting their Books ſeized.</p>
            <p>I have Reprinted a Paper in the <note n="(c)" place="margin">N. IX.</note> Appendix, firſt publiſhed by the <hi>Meſſenger of the Preſs,</hi> That Poſterity may ſee from an Authentick Teſtimony, what a ſevere Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb facs="tcp:62198:6"/> hath been made againſt their Books, and how many of them have been deſtroyed. No Man knew this better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and therefore it was equal Inſolence and Disingenuity in him, to diſparage their Reaſons, when he was ſo conſcious to himſelf of the Endeavours he and others had uſed to ſtifle them in the Birth. Certainly there muſt be ſomething formidable in their Books, and ſome Reaſonings in them, which theſe <hi>Men of Latitude</hi> cannot well Anſwer, that they uſe ſo much diligence to ſuppreſs them, at a time when <hi>Atheiſts, Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Republicans,</hi> print and publiſh what they pleaſe, with little or no moleſtation. Why all this ado to ſuppreſs their Books more than others, if their Reaſonings are not ſtrong? But becauſe he ſaith, That <hi>their Reſentments are ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than their Reaſons,</hi> I have concluded my <hi>Appendix</hi> with a <note n="(a)" place="margin">N.X.</note> Catalogue of their Books which lie unanſwered, and he may try his ſtrength to anſwer any one of them when he will. Some of his Brethren have publiſhed their Reaſons, and been ſoundly baffled by the Men of Reſentment, as he calls them; but he never thought fit to give them Opportunity of anſwering any of his, which makes it intolerable in him to Cenſure their Reaſons in publick, but eſpecially in ſuch an auguſt Aſſembly, before he had publiſhed his own, or anſwered thoſe Things which ſome years ſince have been <note n="(b)" place="margin">In a Book entitled, A Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome among our ſelves, againſt the falſe Principles of Dr. <hi>Sherlock.</hi>

               </gap>owing Objection.

But it ſeems you are yet a Stranger to the very Deſign of Religion, which is to tame and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify Nature and it is not a natural Thing, but ſupernatural. Therefore the Rules of defending and advancing of it, muſt not be borrowed from Nature, but Grace. The Scriptures are alſo ſtrangely contrived, ſince they ever tell us of ſuffering Perſecution without giving your Exception,
<pb facs="tcp:62198:6"/> that we may reſiſt when we are in a Capacity. And I appeal to your Conſcience, whether it be a likelier way to advance Religion by Fighting, or Suffering; ſince a carnal Man can do the one, and not the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a further Proof of that part of the Charge I have drawn up againſt him, in the beginning of the firſt Chapter, of his being a <hi>Man of Contradictions to himſelf;</hi> and I will beg the Reader's leave to prove it with a later Teſtimony. In his Funeral Sermon on Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> he cenſures the deprived Biſhops, but as I have ſhewed very unjuſtly, for leaving their Authority with their Chancellors, and tendering Oaths by them, which they thought unlawful. One would think he ſhould not do that himſelf, which he had ſo publickly objected to them; yet having lately declared to a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I could name, That <hi>his Hand ſhould rot off before he gave him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;</hi> at laſt, to prevent an Inconvenience which otherwiſe muſt have come upon him, he left his Authority with his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to do it, and by him gave him that Inſtitution which he had ſaid with a ſolemn Imprecation he would never do. This Story alſo ſhews him to be a Man of great Paſſions, which often hinder him from Writing as well as Speaking cooly; and this unhappy Temper of his, which is another part of my Charge againſt him, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from what he ſaid in a Conference he had with that Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of whom I here declare I think no worſe, becauſe he thought ſo ill of him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He began with telling him that he was a Church-robber, and that he came over the Wall, and not in at the Door. Then he proceeded to call him Villain, and ſaid he had been guilty of a baſe and villanous Action, worſe by much than robbing on the High-way, and that he would uſe his utmoſt endeavour to keep him out of the Church. He further called him Simonaical and Sacrilegious Raſcal; and ſaid, he knew he muſt give Money to the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Servants to obtain his Orders. Then he proceeded to Reflections on the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and fell very fouly on the <hi>Doctors Commons;</hi> ſaying, he had procured a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of thoſe <hi>Rogues.</hi> To which, when the Gentleman replied, That he obtained it from the <hi>Dean and Chapter of Canterbury,</hi> he paſſionately anſwered, It was the ſame Thing, for that they only granted it for the ſake of Money. He further told him, It ſhould be his continual Buſineſs to expoſe him as long as he lived to his Clergy; and that he would render him as black as he was in his Gown and Caſſock, and take all Opportunities to do it.</q>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:62198:7"/>
            <p>Yet after all this Storm of Fury againſt him, as the worſt of Men in his Eſteem, he gave him Inſtitution by his Chancellor; when, if he was convinced of his Miſtake, he ought to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned himſelf for his raſh Imprecation, and made the Gentleman an honorary Satisfaction for the Injury he had done him, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him Inſtitution himſelf. But if he perſiſted in his ill Opinion of him, then, by his own Rule, he ought not to have devolved his Authority upon his Chancellor, who did that in his Name, and by his Commiſſion and Order, which he thought a Sin to do himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Account the learned Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> hath given of his Printing his <hi>Diſcourſe on the Divinity and Death of Chriſt</hi> much changed, and otherwiſe than he ſpoke it before his Clergy, proves another part of my Charge of his playing Tricks with his own Writings. The like I have been aſſured he did with a Sermon which he preached ſomewhere in <hi>London,</hi> in which he gave the People an Account what the Convocation was to do. And were it not to make a Book of my Preface, I could further ſhew his partial and biaſſed way of Writing, and his proneſs to write his own Inventions for Truth, from ſome Obſervations upon his Book of Travels, which I have heard a Gentleman of great Reputation, lately come from Travelling, make upon ſeveral Paſſages in it. And when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how apt he is to write <hi>Lives,</hi> and to write his own Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Opinions in them, I could not but bewail the Fate of the late honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> after that of Biſhop <hi>Bedel,</hi> ſhould he alſo write his Life, as Report ſaith he Deſigns to do. And I cannot but wiſh, for the Honour of that great Man's Memory, that his honourable Relations would oblige ſome Perſon of unblemiſhed Reputation to write it, whom the World hath no reaſon to ſuſpect, even when he writes Truth.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned Biſhop <hi>Bedel</hi>'s Life, in which I think it is plain our Author had but too great a Part, I am obliged to let the World know, That I had the remarkable Obſervations upon it, which I have put in my following Diſcourſes, out of a M. S. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>OBSERVATIONS UPON BISHOP BEDEL'S LIFE.</hi> The firſt Ground of which were ſome Obſervations formerly made upon it, by the late learned Mr. <hi>Fulman;</hi> who, as I am informed, ſent them to Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> though he was never pleaſed to take Notice of them, and the Reaſon I think is pretty plain, why he did not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt alſo acknowledge, That I had that Account of his foul
<pb facs="tcp:62198:7"/> Dealing with a M. S. in <hi>Bennet College</hi> from a Learned hand, who compared the Printed Copy, and the Original together. And in truth when one conſiders what <hi>Monſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>le Grand, Antony Harmar,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fulman,</hi> and others, have animadverted upon our Author's Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Works, one need not wonder, That he who muſt needs be Conſcious to himſelf of their Diſcoveries, and it may be of more ſuch, ſhould ſpeak ſo much in derogation of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> as he lately did to a young Student, who hath ſince given the World <note n="(a)" place="margin">Noticia Monaſtica.</note> an excellent Proof of his mighty Genius for Hiſtorical Studies and Antiquity. Indeed if all Men had written Hiſtories as Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> knows he hath done, he might well ſpeak againſt the Study of it, as a Thing which is in it ſelf ſo uncertain, and not to be depended upon. If he meaſured other Hiſtorians by himſelf, he might well think that all Hiſtories are full of the ſame Vices that his are; and all Hiſtorians as little to be truſted upon their own bare Authority, as he really is. But to paſs from his greater to his leſſer Works; I cannot but here call to mind the Speech which he made for my Lord <hi>Ruſſel.</hi> When he was examined about it, as I remember, at Council Board, he confeſſed he gave his Lordſhip the Minutes of it; but one is bound in Charity, and Reſpect to his Lordſhip's Memory, to believe that the Doctor made it all, and that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip never conſidered it; becauſe it is ſo like the Doctor in the whole Texture of it, having in it ſomething very impertinent, ſomething queſtionable as to the Truth of it, and ſomething which looks very like contradicting himſelf. I refer the Reader for what I ſay, to the <note n="(b)" place="margin">Entitled, the Lord Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel's Speech vindicated London printed for W. Crooke, <hi>1683.</hi>
               </note> Paper mentioned in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; and to ſay no more of it, the Doctor ſo trinketed in that Affair with his Lordſhip, That Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> was obliged to write that Famous Letter to him a little before his Death, and afterwards carried it to the Secretary of State, and my Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Miniſter for his Vindication; and ſo offended he pretended to be at him for ſomething he did to my Lord, that he ſaid to a Perſon of great Reputation of my Acquaintance, <hi>He would never truſt a Scotch-man more for his ſake.</hi> I know no Reaſon he had to reflect upon his Country, which hath been ſo fruitful in brave Men, and Perſons of the greateſt Honour; but however he truſted him after that Reſolution, and not only truſted him, but let himſelf be too much influenced by him ſince the Revolution.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:62198:8"/>
            <p>To my Account of this Speech, I may add his moſt unjuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerating Character of the Proſecution of the Diſſenters in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> at the later end of <hi>Charles</hi> II's Reign. He deſcribes it in Terms big enough for the <hi>Decian</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: <note n="*" place="margin">At the later end of his Pref. to Lactantius.</note> For he ſaith, it was <hi>reaſonable to think it contributed not a little to fill up the Meaſures of the Sins of the Church, and to bring down ſevere Strokes upon the Members of it.</hi> — that they <hi>let themſelves looſe</hi> to all the Rages of a mad Perſecution — to gratify their own Revenges — <hi>And that they ought ſeriouſly to profeſs their Repentance of this their Fury, in Inſtances that might be as viſible as their Rage hath been publick and deſtructive.</hi>

               </hi> Give an Account of the Blood you have ſhed, and the Families you have ruined. But who can believe a Writer of Story at a greater diſtance, that to gratify Paſſions and ſerve Turns will miſrepreſent ſuch late Tranſactions, and at ſuch an impudent Rate as this? I have ſhewed out of his <hi>Reflections on Varillas,</hi> that he counts it but a ſmall and venial Fault in an <hi>Hiſtorian, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from the exact Laws of Hiſtory in ſetting out the beſt Side of his own Party, and the worſt of his Adverſary, and in ſlightly touching the Failures of the one and ſeverely aggravating thoſe of the other.</hi> This he hath done throughout his Funeral Sermon of Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> and given me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to undeceive the World in the Heroick Character he hath given of him, by noting ſome of his Failings, which bring him down to the mediocrity of other Men. Had he been a more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſon, or acted in a more private Sphere, I ſhould not have called his Canonization of him into queſtion, nor taken the <hi>Glory</hi> from the Picture which he drew of him in his Sermon, and ſent in numerous Copies about the World. But being a Perſon of great and dangerous Example, both to preſent Times and Poſterity, and having acted ſuch a Part as he hath had the Misfo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tune to do, both in Church and State; I thought I ſhould do the Chriſtian World good Service in obſerving ſome of his Errours, Weakneſſes; and Miſdoings; leſt Men now, or hereafter, taking of him indeed for a Man of <hi>unblemiſhed</hi> and <hi>heroick Piety,</hi> ſhould think him imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in every Thing, and follow his dangerous Example where he did ill, as well as where he did well.</p>
            <p>One thing I have taken notice of, was the unfortunate Part he had in ſlandering and wronging the <hi>Two Kings;</hi> and ſince I have
<pb facs="tcp:62198:8"/> concluded my Book, I have heard, that after the Revolution, he did again revive the Report of the <hi>Legitimacy</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth;</hi> which being falſe, whatever Opinion he had of it, is one of the greateſt Slanders to the Memory of one of the Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Injuries to the other, that a Man could be guilty of. It is well known among the Clergy, that one of his moſt <hi>intimate</hi> Acquaintance was very zealous, after the Revolution, in going about to Biſhops, and other Church-men, to try if he could make them believe this old Story to be true; and thence to perſwade them to take the Oath of Allegiance to King <hi>W.</hi> becauſe King <hi>J.</hi> never had any Right to the Crown. I know the idle <hi>Hear-ſays</hi> he told them, to create belief in them of this <hi>Stale Fiction,</hi> and am able to diſprove them all; and I would here tell them, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, but that the great Honour and Reſpect I have for that Duke's illuſtrious Family, will n<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t let me ſay ſome Things in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of them, which I think would be unacceptable to them to hear. But if that <hi>ſecond Self</hi> of Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> will publiſh his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay Stories, which I always ſuſpected he had from him, I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſhew the falſeneſs of them, provided he will do it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while my Witneſſes are alive.</p>
            <p>Another Thing in which Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> fell ſhort of his own Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and was wont to act contrary to it, was in <hi>noting,</hi> like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Brethren, the ſmall Number of the non-complying Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy upon all Occaſions, and deſpiſing of them and their Cauſe, for that they were ſo few. I thought to have obſerved this in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Place in my <hi>ſecond Chapter;</hi> but having forgot it, I will here ſhew in his own Words, what a vain and unmanly Thing it is to argue for or againſt any Church, or Cauſe, from Number; and I am the more willing to ſet them down, That neither his Funeral Orator, nor any other of his ſide hereafter, may boaſt of their Numbers, or deſpiſe any <hi>Suffering Cauſe,</hi> eſpecially becauſe it is embraced but by a Few.

<pb facs="tcp:62198:9"/> it was confined to one People wandering in a Wildnerneſs? What of it in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Time, when beſides the Two Tribes that worſhiped at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there were in the other Ten but Seven thouſand that had not bowed the Knee to <hi>Baal?</hi> What in our Saviour's Time, when the whole Chriſtian Church conſiſted of Twelve Apoſtles, and Seventy Diſciples, and ſome few Followers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide? How would <hi>Bellarmin</hi> have deſpiſed this little Flock, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it wanted one or two of his goodlieſt Marks of the true Church, Univerſality and Splendor? And what think we of the Chriſtian Church in the Height of <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> and <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> when a great part of Chriſtendom was over-run with theſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and the Number of the Orthodox was inconſiderable in compariſon of Hereticks? But what need I urge theſe Inſtances? As if the truth of Religion were to be eſtimated and carried by the <hi>major Vote;</hi> which as it can be an Argument to none but Fools, ſo I dare ſay <hi>no honeſt and wiſe Man</hi> ever made uſe of it for the ſolid Proof of the Truth and Goodneſs of any Church or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. If Multitude be an Argument that Men are in the Right, in vain then hath the Scripture ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to do Evil;</hi> for if this Argument be of any force, the greater Number never go wrong.</q>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>AS nothing of late hath more Entertain'd the World than <hi>Funeral Sermons:</hi> So none of them hath had a more General Reception among Men of <hi>all Sorts,</hi> than that preacht at the Funeral of the late Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whom the Preacher ſtiles, <hi>By Divine Providence Lord Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>Primate and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan of all</hi> England. It was ſent abroad with its <hi>Fiocco</hi> by the <hi>R. R. Father in God</hi> Gilbert <hi>Lord Biſhop of</hi> Sarum; and Men were curious to ſee what he would ſay upon an Occaſion ſo inviting to a Fruitful Invention, while his <hi>Cenſors</hi> of the Houſe were a Sitting.</p>
            <p>I hapned to make a Viſit to a Place, where I found one Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reading of it to three more, who were very attentive to it; I came in almoſt at the Beginning, and having only beg'd the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Text, made no other Interruption. But though I ſaid nothing upon hearing the Words, I marvelled at his Choice of them, That he ſhould pitch upon a Place ſo emphatical for Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering at the Funeral of a Man who never Suffered, nor loved Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; but who, on the contrary, was of a Temper and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution that loved <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Indolency;</hi> of which the Apoſtle enjoy'd little or nothing in the whole Courſe of his Apoſtleſhip: But as he taught ſo was he always practiſing the Evangelical Doctrine of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, of which he hath left us ſeveral ſhort Accounts in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſam'd them all up, <hi>In fighting the good fight of Faith,</hi> a little
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62198:10"/> before his final Martyrdom, when he was ready to be offered, and the time of his <hi>Paſſion</hi> was at hand.</p>
            <p>At the End of this private Lecture, the Gentleman who read, firſt began to Cenſure. Saith he, The little Knowledge I had of Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> makes it not proper for me to judge, whether or no he deſerv'd ſo great a Character as this <hi>Panegyriſt</hi> hath given him; but if he did, it was very unfortunate for his Memory that he ſhould have Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> for his Funeral Orator: A Man, that <hi>how much ſoever he may think himſelf</hi> poſſeſſed of the Eſteem of the World, is very much loſt in it both at Home and Abroad; and upon whoſe Authority very few Men will believe Things that are <hi>true</hi> to be ſo, without other very good proof: Saith <hi>another,</hi> I am well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Writings of Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> and am not a perfect Stranger to his Converſation, and I am ſure the Character this Biſhop has given him is much above his Merit: <hi>Fy, Fy,</hi> That Men of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould ſo flatter in the Pulpit, where Flattering is ſo abominable. He was not <note n="(a)" place="margin">Serm. p. <hi>2.28.</hi>

               <hi>an Example of Heroick Piety and Vertue, his Life was not free from Blemiſhes,</hi> and ſome great ones too, and this the Panegyriſt knows very well. <hi>A third</hi> then began to argue againſt ſome particular Paſſages in his Sermon, particularly againſt the Truth of what he <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 22.</note>ſaith of ſome of our Suffering Biſhops, and the Authority that diſplaced them, which I ſhall hereafter recite: And then <hi>the fourth,</hi> after a little Silence ſaid, with a Critical Authority, That his Sermon was a Boyiſh Piece of Rhetorick, more becoming a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamer than a Preacher, and fitter for a Sophiſter's Desk than a Biſhops Pulpit, having too much the Air of a young Student's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and alſo ſeem'd in ſome parts of it to have too much of Common Place in it, and in others too much Art to be true. Nay, ſaith he, his own <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 10. 11. 60.</note> Reflexions on <hi>Varillas</hi> are here true upon himſelf. His Sermon hath too much <hi>the Air of a Romance;</hi> 'tis too Fine to be true: <hi>He ſeems to write his own Inventions, and ſets abundance of Whipt Cream before his Reader.</hi> And then he told us a Story of a b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind Gentleman, but a good natural Critick, whoſe Cuſtom was to repair very early to St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Church, and to ask who preacht? Saith he, he hapned once to ask me the Queſtion, and when I told him Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> was to preach, then in truth, ſaith he, we ſhall have a <hi>Whipt Sillibub:</hi> And I think, ſaid he Smiling, Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s whipt Sillibub is as far from the Nature of ſtrong and manly Meat, as Monſieur <hi>Varillas</hi>'s
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62198:10"/> whipt Cream. A Preacher, eſpecially at Funerals, ought to avoid Strains; and when he ſpeaks of the Defunct, to ſpeak more like an Hiſtorian than an Orator: But this Man's Eloquence, to uſe his own Words of <note n="(a)" place="margin">Pref. to Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> 
               <hi>Lactantius, carries him often into Strains that become a young Orator better than an Hiſtorian, for he hath a heat of Stile that ought not to be imitated by one that would write truth;</hi> but it may be, ſaith he, Smiling again in his Words of <hi>Lactantius, He deſign'd his Sermon for a mixt ſort of Writing between a Declamation and a Funeral Sermon, and ſo may think that the Figures which agree not to the one may be allow'd in the other.</hi>

And ſpeak Gentlemen, ſaith he, you have all heard this Panegyrick; very many fine Things and Generals are ſaid in it, but after all, I can ſcarce tell for what he commends his Metropolitan: All his pompous Figures have raiſed in me no great Idea of the Man; for after all my Attention, I find very little Sticks behind; nor do I think this Performance will do his Memory much Service, or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it with Advantage to Poſterity.</p>

            <p>THis is the Short of what paſſed in this little Court of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon this Biſhop's Funeral Sermon; and I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to diſcourſe upon it in the ſame Order, and begin with that which he will think the ſevereſt Part of it, which is to ſhew, That though what he ſaid of the late Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi> were true, yet no Man ought, as I believe few will, believe it upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62198:11"/> his Authority; becauſe he hath ſo contradicted himſelf, and the moſt ſerious Parts of his own Writings; and is ſo apt to write his own Fancys and Inventions for truth, and to write with Biaſs and Partiality to ſerve a Turn; to prevaricate and play Tricks with his own and other Mens Work; to let himſelf be tranſported with Paſſion, which hinders him from writing in <hi>cool Blood;</hi> and is not a whit alſo behind <hi>Varillas</hi> in that <hi>bold Quality,</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Reflexions on Varillas, p. <hi>15.</hi>
               </note> which he tells him he <hi>loves not to ſet down by its proper Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove this Charge, which I have drawn up againſt him, I muſt now and then mention Things which are not commonly known of him, beginning with that <hi>Circular Letter</hi> which he ſent to all the Biſhops of <hi>Scotland</hi> above 20 Years ago. In this Letter he boldly reflected upon them, and the Clergy, for fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the Court, and great Mens Houſes; for keeping of Coaches, though the Primate was the only Perſon that kept a Coach among them, and for converting the Money of their Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Revenues to their own proper Uſes. The ſeveral Copies of this Letter were all, or moſt of them, written in his own hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; that which I ſaw was left in <hi>England</hi> by the worthy Primate of his Name, when he was Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> and among others it was read by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Haſcard</hi> who pretended to loſe it; and I appeal to them not only for the Truth of theſe few Reflexions, which I remember in it at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but for the Impudence of the whole Letter, which I heard one of them ſay he could not have believed, unleſs he had ſeen. Not long after the Writing of this Letter he came to <hi>London,</hi> where the Reflexions above-mentioned, and others, were the common Topicks of his Diſcourſes upon the Clergy. Dr. <hi>Outram</hi> once told me that he entertain'd him, as I remember, at the firſt Viſit which he gave him, upon the ſubject of Clergy-mens haunting of Courts, and Noble-mens Houſes, but the next day the good Doctor hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to take the Air in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park ſaw his young Reformer in the <hi>Mall</hi> walking and ſtalking with Two or Three <hi>Foreign Miniſters;</hi> and this, with ſome other Obſervations which he and ſome others made of his Plying at Court, particularly at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and being ſeen, above all Divines about the Town, in Noble-mens Houſes, and in their Coaches, made him loſe his reſpect for him, and preſage Things of him in ſome ominous Expreſſions, which have ſince come to paſs. The World knows very well how contrary the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62198:11"/> whole Courſe of his Life hath been, and ſtill is, to theſe Self deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pretenſions, and particularly as to the Levying and Taking Fines for Church Lands, and Converting them to his own, and not to the Churches uſe, which he condemns in his <note n="(a)" place="margin">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62198:12"/> a Conformiſt and a Nonconformiſt,</hi> Printed at <hi>Glaſcow</hi> in Seven Dialogues, 1669. In the Seventh Dialogue he tells the <hi>Noncon,</hi> That the firſt Precedent in Hiſtory for Subjects fighting upon the Account of Religion was Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, who armed the Subjects of <hi>Germany</hi> againſt the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth; and that the lateſt is the Holy League of <hi>France,</hi> from which our whole Matter (ſaith he) ſeems tranſcribed; and then asks <hi>Noncon,</hi> If he was not aſhamed in a Matter of ſuch importance to ſymbolize with the worſt Gang of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; for, ſaith he, the better Sort condemn it. And I think we have much more Reaſon, after the Writing of this, to ask him the ſame Queſtion; and if he had any Conſcience or Shame, one would think he ſhould be aſhamed to ſymbolize with them, and to ſee himſelf, and the greater part of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (if they can now be ſaid to be of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) follow the Example of the worſt part of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Methinks he ſhould bluſh now at this juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, if Something, as bad as he thinks the Order, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Pref. to the Hiſtory of the Rights of Princes p. <hi>39.</hi>

I hope it is a juſt Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that forces this Reflexion from me; but if it ſeems too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, I beg the Reader's Patience till I lay before him another of this unhappy Man's Books, intituled, <hi>A Vindication of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the Church and State of</hi> Scotland, Printed 1673. This Book is full of very many Doctrins, Rules and Precepts, to which the Author's Life, and all his Books ſince the beginning of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have been an open Contradiction. In the Entrance of his Preface to the Reader, ſaith he, <hi>How ſad, but how full a Commentary doth the Age we live in give of thoſe Words of our Lord;</hi> I am come to ſend Fire on Earth, Suppoſe you that I am come to give Peace upon Earth, I tell you nay, but rather Diviſion. <hi>Do we not ſee the Father divided againſt the Son, and the Son againſt the Father; and engaging into ſuch angry Heats, and mortal Feuds, upon Colours of Religion, as if the Seed of the Word of God, like</hi> Cadmus <hi>Teeth, had ſpawned a Generation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62198:12"/> of Cruel and Blood thirſty Men: But how ſurprizing is the Wonder when Religion becomes the Pretence.</hi> And after this; <hi>Among all the Hereſies this Age hath ſpawned, there is not one more contrary to the whole Deſign of Religion, and more deſtructive of Mankind, than is that bloody Opinion of defending Religion by Arms, and of forceable Reſiſtance upon the Colour of preſerving Religion. The Wiſdom of this Policy is Earthly, Senſual, and Devilliſh; ſavouring of a carnal, unmortified, and unpatient Mind, that cannot bear the Croſs, nor truſt to the Providence of God.</hi> Religion then as well as ſince was the Civil Property of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but at the time of the Revolution <note n="(a)" place="margin">In his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Meaſures of Submiſſion to the Supreme Authority.</note> he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the Chriſtian Religion from it ſelf as Religion, and as it was one of the principal Rights and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Subject; and though as <hi>Religion</hi> it ought not to be defended by Arms, yet he affirmed, That as a Civil Right and Property it might. Would any Man but ſuch a Biſhop have had the Confidence to ſay, That it was Lawful to ſight for Religion, as a <hi>Civil Right and Property,</hi> who had publiſhed the Book above-mentioned, and I know not how many after it, to prove it Unlawful for Subjects to take up Arms in defence, or under pretence of defending any Right or Property whatſoever? Let ſuch a Man ſay of Things or Perſons, or of Perſons Dead or Living, what he pleaſes; he ſhall never be believed by me, farther than he brings Proof.</p>
            <p>The Paſſages of his forecited Book, which now ſtare him in the Face, are very many, and very Emphatical; and there is ſcarce a Page in it which is not a Record againſt him: I muſt take notice of ſome, and recommend <note n="(b)" place="margin">

               <hi>Enquiry into the preſent State of Affairs,</hi> which is his, though he does not own it, were both written upon the Principles of the Reſiſting and Depoſing Power.

Say not then, They were not able to have ſtood to their Defence, when it appears how great their Numbers were, or ſhall I here tell you the known Story of the</hi> Thebean Legion <hi>which Conſiſted of</hi> 6666. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Year 1673. the Stories of the Primitive Martyrs, and this in particular, left a Fervour upon his Mind, which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt in his uſual Studies; but in 1687, the Year before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, he ſtages it for a copious and incredible <hi>Legend</hi> in his Preface before <hi>Lactantius,</hi> without ſo much as telling the World, that he had been in that common Errour of the Learned, and thought the Fable true.</p>
            <p>The Arguments with which he Aſſaults it are all Negative, and ſuch as one would think he could not believe himſelf. Firſt, he argues againſt it from the Silence of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> though <note n="(a)" place="margin">Hiſt. Eccl. l. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Diocleſian</hi> Perſecution profeſſes to omit many of the Conflicts of thoſe who ſuffered in divers Parts of the Empire, leaving them to be deſcribed by thoſe that were Eye witneſſes to them. Secondly, from the Silence of <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> who mentions not one ſingle Fact of that Perſecution; ſaying no more of it, than that it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued X Years, in which time the whole World was Dyed with the Blood of the Martyrs: The Chriſtians then ſtriving for Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which, he ſaith, <hi>was more ſought for among them than Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks by the ambitious Clergy of his time; from whence it came to paſs, That the World was never ſo much waſted by any War that ſtands upon Record in Hiſtory, as by that Perſecution ſucceſſively for X Years, in which the Chriſtians had ſo many Triumphs. (The Famous Martyrdoms of that time are yet extant, which I ſhall not ſet down here, becauſe I would keep within the ſmall Compaſs of this little Work.)</hi> This is the ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Perſecution in <hi>Sulpitius;</hi> and if the Chriſtians of the Empire then ſtrove for Martyrdom upon the ſtupid Principle of Non-reſiſtance, why might not a Chriſtian Legion, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a Non-reſiſting Leader, grow as ſtupid as other Chriſtians? And if all the World (which is the Phraſe for all the Empire) was Dyed with Chriſtian Blood, why might not <hi>Agaunum</hi> have as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62198:14"/> deep a Tincture, as any other Place? But <hi>Agaunum</hi> was in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius,</hi> ſays he, excepts the <hi>Gauls</hi> from Perſecution: But the <hi>Thebean Legion</hi> were Strangers, and not <hi>Gauls;</hi> and though <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> might protect the <hi>Gauls,</hi> he had no Right to protect them; or if he had, he could not prevent what happen'd to them; their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution being not a State of Perſecution, but a Caſual unforeſeen <hi>Days-work</hi> of Military Diſcipline on the Edge of <hi>Gaul,</hi> where <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> was not preſent to countermand or oppoſe it. But if he had been preſent, he could have had no Authority to have hinder'd it, becauſe it was done by the Command of <hi>Maximian,</hi> who was <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus;</hi> and as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had Authority over <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who was then but <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and ſo by the <hi>Diocleſian</hi> Conſtitution of the Empire was ſubject to his Authority. But he, ſaith <hi>Lanctantius,</hi> muſt needs have heard of ſo remarkable a Tranſaction as the Paſſion of this Legion, if it were true. Here is the Negative Argument again; but I ſay it might be true, and he yet not hear of it: For it was but a few hours work of military Diſcipline in an obſcure Corner of the <hi>Alps,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> was at that time in <hi>Africk,</hi> where, to uſe his own Argument upon another Occaſion, <note n="(a)" place="margin">A Relation of a Conference had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion by Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Stillingfleet, and Gilbert Burnet, p. <hi>119.</hi>
               </note> there was neither Printing, nor Stages for Pacquets, nor Publiſhing of Mercuries, Gazettes, and Journals; and Men were not wont to amuſe themſelves at what was doing in the World.</p>
            <p>I could tell him of a Mornings Work, in the High-lands of his own Country, not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like this in Cruelty, and done about Three years ago, which half of this Nation, and of the Clergy themſelves, have not yet heard of; and of thoſe that have, if they were to write an Hiſtory of the Revolution, few of them would mention it; not excepting our Funeral Orator, who I have Reaſon to think would be content to paſs it over in Silence, though I do believe Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Father to Son will preſerve an Account of it in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Glancow,</hi> as it did that of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion till the time of <hi>Euch<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ius,</hi> who was the firſt that committed it to Writing. But in one Word, the Silence of <hi>Lactantius</hi> is no Argument againſt the Truth of it, who in his Hiſtory paſſed over whole Perſecutions, which, one would think, he muſt needs have heard of; and who in the Reign of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> deſcribing only the <hi>Decennial Perſecution,</hi> which began at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> could not by the terms of his Account mention the Maſſacre of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion, which was done ſo many
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62198:14"/> Years before. No Man would reaſonably expect an Account of the fatal and bloody Fight at <hi>Edge Hill,</hi> from an Hiſtorian that commences his Hiſtory from the Tryal of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, or the Reſtauration of his Son; and therefore if our Panegyriſt hath no better Arguments againſt the truth of that Story of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he may read it ſtill with his old wonted Fervour; or if he thinks it worth his pains, he may proceed to find out new Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt it, which ſuch learned Men as <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> have not yet found out; but though I have a great Deference for their Authority, and that Story upon the Account of it, yet I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd whether it be Truth or a Fiction, and will only put him in Mind that the very Fiction of it proves that the Doctrine of <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance,</hi> however now exploded by him, was the general Belief and Practiſe of the Antient Chriſtians, and a Badg of their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Times of Perſecution, as much as Baptiſm it ſelf, or any Article in their Creed. They call'd it the Doctrine of the Croſs, and he once pretended to be all Primitive, and all Chriſtian for it: It uſed to create a <hi>Fervour</hi> in his Blood, but now he is turned Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate from it, and from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> although he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be a Biſhop of it according to his own Words, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Serm on the <hi>30</hi> of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary <hi>1672.</hi> p. <hi>36.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>This Doctrine we juſtly Glory in; and if any, who have had their Baptiſm and Education in our Church, have turn'd RENEGADOS from it, They prov'd no leſs Enemies to the Church herſelf, than to the Civil Authority; So that their APOSTACY leaves no Blame upon our Church.</hi> No in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! His Apoſtacy leaves no Blame on it; but however it is ſuch a Blot upon himſelf, that if I were one of thoſe, as I profeſs I am not, who thought Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> deſerved the Praiſes he has given him, I ſhould be ſorry that an Apoſtate, and an Apoſtate by his own Confeſſion, ſhould be his Encomiaſt, and tranſmit his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Poſterity. For Divines that contradict themſelves, and their moſt ſerious Doctrines, which they preſſed upon the Conſciences of Men, as he hath done, are always to be Suſpected; and as for himſelf, he, above all others, hath brought upon himſelf the Fate of <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> and is not to be believ'd when he ſpeaks Truth upon his own Authority: And if what I have hitherto ſaid will not juſtifie the Severity of this Cenſure, I hope what I am going to write will.</p>
            <p>In his firſt Letter to my Lord <hi>Middleton,</hi> bearing Date the 27th of <hi>May,</hi> 1687. he tells his Lordſhip, That few have preacht more than
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62198:15"/> himſelf againſt all ſorts of Treaſonable Doctrines and Practices, and particularly againſt the Lawfulneſs of riſing in Arms upon account of Religion.— I have preacht a whole Sermon at the <hi>Hague,</hi> ſaith he, againſt all Treaſonable Doctrines and Practices, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar againſt the Lawfulneſs of Subjects riſing in Arms againſt their Sovereigns upon the account of Religion, and I have maintained this both in Publick and Private; ſo that I could, if I thought it convenient, give Proofs of it, that would make all my Enemies aſhamed.— As often as I have talked with Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi>— I took occaſion to repeat my Opinion of the Duty of Subjects to ſubmit and <hi>bear all the ill Adminiſtration that might be in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but never to riſe in Arms upon that Account. And in his third Letter to his Lordſhip, bearing Date <hi>Hague</hi> 27. <hi>June,</hi> 1687. he concludes with theſe Words; <hi>But to the laſt Moment of my Life I will pay all Duty and Fidelity to his Majeſty.</hi> And yet before the Date of theſe Letters, wherein he makes ſuch high and ſolemn Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his Principles of Loyalty, and of his Duty to the King, he was engaged in one of the Deepeſt and moſt Heinous Treaſons that Subject was ever engaged in againſt his Sovereign; I mean, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the <hi>Princeſs of Orange</hi> to Conſent to the unnatural Invaſion of her Father's Kingdom by the Prince, which then was reſolv'd upon, and with him to take his Crown, if the Invaſion ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. This he thought ſo meritorious and honourable a Piece of Service, that ſoon after he came to <hi>London,</hi> he could not deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Satisfaction of telling ſome Friends, That he was the Man pitcht upon to break the Deſign of depoſing the King her Father to her Royal Highneſs Two Years before the Revolution; and that he gained her Conſent, upon Condition that the Prince might aſſume the Royal Power with her, and be Crowned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her.</p>
            <p>He told it to this purpoſe in the Deanry-houſe of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and for the Truth of it I appeal to the then Dean of that Church Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet,</hi> and to the worthy Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> I mean Dr. <hi>White,</hi> who was preſent when he ſpoke to that Effect; and I make bold to mention his good Name, becauſe he hath ſpoken of it in many Places; and to this Authority I could add that of a Right honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſon of great Eſteem, in whoſe Hearing he ſpake in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place to the ſame purpoſe. Let this be written upon his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, and embalm his Memory to Poſterity, That he was the Man who perſwaded the yet innocent Daughter, <hi>Abſalon</hi> like, to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62198:15"/> conſpire the Deſtruction of her Father, and to ſeize his Throne. This he did againſt a King, who, according to his own Expreſſion of the King his Father, was, by a <note n="(a)" place="margin">Serm. on the <hi>30</hi> of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, <hi>1674.</hi> p. <hi>7.</hi>

               <hi>Tract of undiſputed Succeſſion, what</hi> Saul <hi>was by immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God's Anointed:</hi> And after he had done it, he again promiſed Fidelity to him to the laſt Moment of his Life; and after that again invaded his Kingdom, and uſed him the worſt of all his Enemies. I have been told that he was a Year in overcoming that unhappy Princeſs into this unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reſolution; and if any one deſire to know what Arguments, and of what Sort he uſed to pervert her, I am of Opinion he may find them in a <hi>French</hi> Book, called, <hi>Le Salut de la France;</hi> which was written by <hi>Mounſieur Jurieu,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Miniſter, to perſwade the Dauphin of <hi>France,</hi> to whom it is addreſſed, to dethrone his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They were both great Acquaintance one with the other, both lived together in <hi>Holland,</hi> both great Enthuſiaſts, both acted with the utmoſt Revenge againſt their reſpective Sovereigns, both engaged in the Intereſts of the Confederacy, and it would be very ſtrange if two ſuch Wits and Incendiaries, ſo agreeing in their Temper, Deſign, and their way of Writing, ſhould not jump in their Arguments on this Subject. At the ſame time he was at work with the Princeſs he wrote many Seditious Libels to diſaffect the People of theſe Kingdoms againſt the King; contrary not only to his profeſſed Fidelity, but to the Reſpect he had before pretended was due to Crown'd Heads. In his <note n="(b)" place="margin">

And in his Letter to <hi>Mounſieur Thavenot,</hi> he is very ſevere upon <hi>M. le Grand</hi> for ſpeaking hardly of our <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. telling him, That there is a Reverence due to the Aſhes of Kings, which ought to make us ſpeak of their Faults in the ſafeſt Words, and avoid ſuch reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones, as <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Impoſture.</hi> To which <hi>M. le Grand</hi> cries out in his Note upon that Paſſage, <hi>Behold this Man who fills</hi> England <hi>and</hi> France <hi>with the moſt Seditious and Outragious Libels, that were ever made againſt any Prince, ſpeaking at this rate.</hi> And I ſay, behold this Man, with all his Fidelity to his own King, and all the Reſpect he had profeſſed to Crown'd Heads, treating his own Sovereign <hi>as if he had not been anointed with Oyl.</hi> At <hi>Exeter</hi> he would not let them ſay the Morning and Evening Prayer for the King's Majeſty; at <hi>Salisbury</hi> he ſat down when it was ſaid; and at another Place in

No, this is the true Character of Religion which he gives in oppoſition to that of <note n="(d)" place="margin">Reflections, p. <hi>39.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>M. Varillas,</hi> who, as he tells us, ſaith, <hi>That in Matters of Religion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth ſo intirely conquer all the Powers of the Soul, and reduces them to ſuch a Slavery, that it forces a Man to write that which it dictates, without troubling himſelf whether it be true or falſe.</hi> And it is evident from what I have ſaid, That he hath had many ſuch Fits of Religion; and that he was in a great and long Fit of it all the while he ſupplied Satan's Place, and did the Office of a Tempter to the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> till he overcame her into a Conſent to diſhonour her Father more than <hi>Cham</hi> did his, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all to take Poſſeſſion of his Crown. Without ſuch Religious Fits of writing Things, <hi>whether true or falſe,</hi> he could never arrive to ſuch Perfection of writing Contradictions to ſerve turns. In his Sermon before the Prince of O. at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, he tells us his Royal Highneſs came abhorring Conqueſt. In his Paſtoral Letter he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances his imaginary Conqueſt of us into an Argument for Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62198:16"/> to him; and afterwards in his <note n="(a)" place="margin">

            <p>But to go on, to ſhew how Unfortunate he hath been in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his own Authority; in the firſt Volume of his <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation,</hi> he <note n="(b)" place="margin">P. <hi>108.</hi> When Hen. IV. had treaſonably U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpt the Crown.</note> ſpeaks of <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. as of a Traytor, and Uſurper, and yet, as I obſerved before, contrary to all the Acts of Parliament which declare him, and his Son, and Grandſon Uſurpers; and which it is a Diſparagement to his Character, as an Hiſtorian to ſuppoſe him ignorant of, in his <hi>Enquiry into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Affairs,</hi> he aſſerts, That the Depoſition of <hi>Ric.</hi> II. was never condemned by any ſubſequent Acts of Parliament. Surely when he wrote this, his Conſcience was in a great Fit, neither conſidering what he had written before, nor whether he wrote true or falſe.</p>
            <p>The next Place in which I muſt ſet him to be viewed in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to himſelf, is his Preface to <hi>Lactantius;</hi> where I muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare what he hath written of <hi>Perſecution, Perſecutors,</hi> and the <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,</hi> with what he hath done againſt the preſent Sufferers, againſt whom he hath been a very <hi>Bonner</hi> to the utmoſt of his Power, and thirſted after their Deſtruction. Shortly after the Revolution, asking an honourable Gentleman, if he would not come into the Government? And he anſwering, He could not; then, ſaith he, we will drive you out of the Kingdom, or you ſhall drive us. On <hi>Sept.</hi> 4. 1690. he told <note n="(c)" place="margin">See Paper <hi>1.</hi> in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</note> Dr. <hi>Beach,</hi> whom I mention with that great Eſteem which is due to his Piety and Learning, that he hoped by the next <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> not to ſee one deprived Clergy-man left in the Kingdom; ſaying, that they were worſe than Papiſts, and that he would ſhew more Mercy to a Popiſh Prieſt than to any one of them. And when the Doctor replied, I hope we ſhall find Juſtice, if not Mercy: He anſwered, I will ſhew you neither; I will proſecute you to the utmoſt Extremity. And I believe the Doctor hath found that he was as good as his Word. This Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and Gentle Temper of his, in obſtructing Juſtice, as well as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62198:17"/> Mercy, from the ſuffering Remnant, appeared the laſt Year in the Houſe of Lords; where he ſpoke not againſt the Cauſe, but the Perſon of an honourable and moſt worthy Gentleman, againſt whom, becauſe he had been Kind and Hoſpitable to his Fellow-Sufferers, he harangued it in a manner altogether unbecoming his Character, both as a Biſhop, and a Judg. Had he argued againſt the Juſtice or Equity of his Cauſe, he had ſpoken as became his Place; but having nothing to ſay againſt <hi>that,</hi> he ſpoke againſt <hi>him,</hi> as a Perſon diſaffected to the Government, who made his Houſe a common Harbour to the Enemies of it. This might have looked proper had the Gentleman ſued to the Houſe for a Favour; but being a Suiter for Juſtice, and before the laſt Reſort, he ſpoke not like a Judg but an Enemy, and a Perſecutor, who regards Men more than Cauſes; and indeed like one who hath neither Bowels of Mercy, nor Conſcience of Juſtice, for thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Perſons, whoſe greateſt Fault is (to uſe his <note n="(a)" place="margin">Preface to Lactantius.</note> own Words) <hi>That they cannot think of ſome Things as he doth, nor ſubmit their Reaſons to his.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he inveighed bitterly againſt a moſt pious and learned Gentleman to his Father, for keeping Company with, and entertaining ſome of the Non-ſwearing Clergy, whom in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his four Diſcourſes he calls <hi>falſe Brethren,</hi> who pretend to be of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but are not, and are of the <hi>Synagogue of Satan.</hi> This evil Spirit of Perſecution ſhewed it ſelf in a Zeal for an <hi>Oath of Abjuration,</hi> when ſpeaking like himſelf in the Houſe, he ſaid to this Effect; <hi>Let him die the Death of a Dog, and be buried with the Burial of an Aſs, that wiſhes or hopes for the return of K</hi> James. It hath alſo ſhewed its cloven Foot in his <hi>Funeral Sermon;</hi> and it would be endleſs to recite the intemperate Speeches which, upon the leaſt Occaſion, he is apt to vent againſt a Company of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Men; who, to uſe the Words of his own Plea for the <hi>Perſecuted,</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>have no other Fault, but that they cannot ſhake off the Principles of their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſtick ſo faſt to the worſt ſort of Men, that Atheiſts themſelves cannot ſhake them off ſo entirely, but that they will be apt to return upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he that pretended to be ſo far from Perſecuting Men of any Perſwaſion, that he apologiz'd even for Atheiſts, is now all Fury and Perſecution againſt thoſe, who, as the late Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph</hi> frankly obſerved to Archbiſhop <hi>Sancroft,</hi> are the Men that preſerve the Nation from Atheiſm. Nay, he apologizes even
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62198:17"/> for Idolaters, and argues in the following manner for To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, and Forbearance. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>That a Man is ſcarce the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his own Thoughts, and Conſtitution; that he cannot ſee Things in another Light, than that to which he hath been accuſtomed to view them; That he can no more change his Notions of Things, becauſe a ſet of new Opinions would accommodate him better, than change the Reliſh of his Senſes; and that the forcing a Man to ſay or do otherwiſe than he thinks by Threatnings, the Execution whereof is above his Force to endure, is only the delivering up ſuch a Perſon to the Rack of his own Conſcience here, and the Portion of Hypocrites hereafter.</hi> Theſe, and many more Things, he then wrote to ſerve a Turn in behalf of the Perſecuted againſt Perſecution; but now the Scene is ſhifted he acts a contrary part to what he acted before: Not conſidering how his former Writings reproach his preſent Practices, and with what an ill Grace he perſecutes now. Of Perſecution he ſaith, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>That it ariſes from an imperious Temper of Mind, and a Spirit impatient of Contradiction; that it hath moſt effect on baſe minded Men, and works quite contrary on generous Minds, and awakened Underſtandings; that it vitiates the Morals of Perſecutors; that Perſecutors do naturally engage themſelves into the Intrigues of Courts; that though they triumph for a while with the Spoils of their Enemies, yet they will ſoon feel how it ſinks their Credit among indifferent Spectators, and good natured Men;</hi> and abundance more to this purpoſe. And yet forgeting all he hath ſaid with ſuch a <hi>Copia</hi> on this Subject, he hath ſignaliz'd himſelf in the Perſecution of thoſe he calls <hi>Jacobites,</hi> though their Books and Apologies lie unanſwered; and particularly thoſe Two that were written againſt his <hi>Enquiry into the Meaſures of Submiſſion</hi> &amp;c. and his Phoenix <hi>Paſtoral Letter,</hi> in which, as he ſaith of <hi>Varillas, His Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Prevarications are laid open in a manner capable of making any Man bluſh beſides himſelf; but he hath neither had the Conſcience to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his Errours, nor the Senſe of Honour to juſtify himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Thing which ſtands in contradiction to him, and to his whole Practice in complying with the preſent Government, but moſt of all with his perſecuting Zeal for it, is a Paſſage in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions on <hi>Parliamentum Pacificum</hi> in the following Words: <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is propoſed to the Imitation of the Nation, is that Parliament which called in the late King, and yet that cannot ſo much as be called a Parliament, unleſs it be upon a common-wealth Principle; that the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power is radically in the People; for it being choſen without the King's Writ was ſuch an ESSENTIAL NULLITY that no ſubſequent Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification could take it away.</hi> Methinks this Paſſage, if he had a Mind
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62198:18"/> to remember it, ſhould oblige him to treat the <hi>Non-ſwearers,</hi> if not with Reſpect, yet with Gentleneſs: For if it is not a ſufficient Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of them againſt the Government, yet while it ſtands unretracted, it is an unanſwerable Vindication of them againſt him and confutes every Thing he hath written againſt them; and eſpecially that impudent <note n="(a)" place="margin">Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Serm. before the K and Q. p. <hi>19.</hi>
               </note> Paſſage, in which he aſſerts, That K. <hi>W. was raiſed up to the Throne by a Title that let</hi> ungrateful Men <hi>ſay what they will, hath more both from God and Man in it, than any the World hath ſeen for many Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to Things of ſomething a different Nature; but which will ſhew no leſs what little Credit is to be given to him, and how unſafe it is to rely upon his Authority. He dedicated his <hi>Vindication of the Authority,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the Laws of</hi> Scotland to the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> then High Commiſſioner of <hi>Scotland:</hi> In that Dedication he tells the Duke, <hi>How worthily he bore that noble Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, with the more laſting and noble Characters of a Princely mind; and praiſes him for the long uninterrupted Tranquility that Kingdom had enjoyed under his wiſe and happy Conduct;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>That he was a Prince greater in his Mind than Fortune; and that there was ſomething inward to him, which commanded all the Reſpect that could be paid by all ſuch that had the Honour to know him, as well as he did.</hi> He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges alſo the <hi>particular</hi> Engagement <hi>by which he was obliged to him;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>That it was not fit for him to expreſs the Senſe he had of them, and of the vaſt Endowments of his mind, for fear he ſhould ſeem to flatter him.</hi> Then he inſtances in the <hi>profoundneſs of his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and well-ballanced Judgment; for which he might deſervedly paſs for a Maſter in all Learning.</hi> And, in the Concluſion, tells him, <hi>That from him they expected an happy Settlement, and wiſhed that Succeſs and Bleſſings might attend his Endeavours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after the Printing this Book at <hi>Glaſcow</hi> he brought a great part of the Impreſſion to <hi>London,</hi> where he ſold it to Mr. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Pitt;</hi> and not long after that again, he came to him to deſire him with great Earneſtneſs to ſell the Copies of it without the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication: For by this time the Duke had fallen out with him, and diſcarded him for ſome Arts and Qualities he had obſerved in him, which I need not name. Mr. <hi>Pitt</hi> gave him very good Reaſons why he ought not to do ſo; and particularly told him, he could not honeſtly ſell an imperfect for a perfect Copy: Upon which he was angry, and threatned him with the Loſs of all the Favours he intended to do him in his Trade. This Mr. <hi>Pitt</hi> can teſtify, if he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62198:18"/> is Living; but if he is not, it can be atteſted by an honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who heard him ſolicit Mr. <hi>Pitt</hi> to this baſe unworthy Practice. But though Mr. <hi>Pitt</hi> would not conſent to ſell the Books without the Dedication, yet he was conſent to let him have them again; and then they came abroad without it. And ſo hard it was 'till it was privately Reprinted to get one ſingle Copy with it, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I could never get ſuch a one, 'till a Gentleman preſented me with one out of his private Study. And when he dilated his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron to the Houſe of Commons, Sir <hi>A. Ferreſter,</hi> his Grace's Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, told me, That after the utmoſt Diligence he could get but one ſingle Copy with the Dedication, though he would have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed more at any Rate, to ſhew the Gentlemen of the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſe what kind of Man his <hi>Evidencer</hi> was, that would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſuch Things in the Commendation of the Duke, after he knew, <note n="(a)" place="margin">See his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication in his XVIII Papers.</note> as he pretended, <hi>he had a Deſign of bringing in an Army out of</hi> Scotland <hi>for the ſpoiling and ſubduing of</hi> England. This Diſcovery of the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his Suppreſſing of it, coming to be known, made all the Houſe curious to ſee it; and he foreſeeing what uſe would be made of it againſt him, was willing to decline his Noble Undertaking: But the Houſe, by the Intereſt of the Duke's Friends, who increaſed much upon that Diſcovery, made him teſtify what, he ſince ſaith, <hi>created Horrour</hi> in him; and how much Reputation he got by it I need not now tell the World. I am ſure many of the Duke's greateſt Enemies looked upon it as an horrible Lye; not thinking the Deſign, or the Diſcovery of it if he had deſigned it, conſiſtent with ſo much Wiſdom as he was Maſter of, a<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ove moſt great Men of his time.</p>
            <p>The next Thing of this Nature which I ſhall relate, concerns his <hi>Memoirs of the Dukes of</hi> Hamilton; he had prepared that Book for the Preſs before the Breach which happen'd betwixt him and the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and intended to dedicate it alſo to him; and accordingly when he had finiſhed his firſt Original of it he gave the Duke a fair Copy, which he deſired his Grace to peruſe in order to the Printing thereof. In this Copy ſeveral remarkable Things are related for the Honour of the Duke, with very great Characters of him: But before his Grace had leiſure to read this Copy, the Difference broke out between them, and then the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs</hi> were publiſhed without them; as may be ſeen in the Copy which is ſtill extant (though I fear his <hi>Circular Letter,</hi> and <hi>Caſe of Barrenneſs</hi> hereafter mentioned, are not) and one day, I hope,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62198:19"/> will be publiſhed; and then the World will ſee, and, I believe, ſay more of him than I deſire to ſay now.</p>
            <p>The next Thing concerns a marginal Note againſt <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> in the 446 Page of Biſhop <hi>Bedel</hi>'s Life; where under a Paſſage in one of the Biſhop's Letters, that ſeems to favour Reſiſtance, he hath put theſe Words. <hi>This Paſſage above is to be conſidered as a Relation, and not as the Author's Opinion. But yet for fear of taking it by the wrong handle, the Reader is deſired to take Notice, That a Subject's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting his Prince, in any Court whatſoever, is unlawful and impious.</hi> This Note of his being remember'd by ſome after the Revolution, and coming very much to be talked of, many curious Perſons were deſirous to ſee it; but when they came to the Bookſellers to conſult the Place (for the Book was never but once Printed) they found it altered thus. <hi>This Paſſage above is to be conſidered as a Relation, and not as the Author's Opinion, leſt it ſhould mislead the Reader into a dangerous Miſtake:</hi> And it is obſervable at firſt Sight, That that ſingle Leaf had been Reprinted for the ſake of the Alteration, and Paſted into all the Copies where it is found. One may preſume that his Bookſeller durſt not make this Alteration without ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from him; and thoſe who are ſo curious as to compute when it began to be ſold without it, found it was a little time after the Revolution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Caſe of Barrenneſs</hi> above-mentioned was drawn up by him at the time when the talk was that Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> was to be divorced from <hi>Charles</hi> the II. Every Body knows that this was a Project of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and his Party, to put by the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from ſucceeding to the Crown. And as for this Caſe which looked that way, I had the Honour, with ſeveral others, to have it ſhewn me by a Right honourable Perſon, and many more of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have ſeen it beſides. I cannot now give ſo particular an Account of the State of the Caſe, as others who have ſeen it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may: But thus much in the general I remember, That after urging the Inconveniences that Barrenneſs brings upon Families, and Succeſſions, he determines in the affirmative, That it is a juſt Cauſe of Divorce. At the leaſt this is very dangerous and looſe Caſuiſtry, and contrary to the Determinations of the whole Stream of <hi>Canoniſts, Civilians,</hi> and <hi>Divines.</hi> It would have helped to have divorced more Queens and Princeſſes than <hi>Catherine,</hi> and God and his own Conſcience know beſt at whoſe Motion, and for what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he wrote it; and I leave him, as well as my Readers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Female Sex, to reflect upon what I ſay.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62198:19"/>
            <p>The next Inſtance of his Ingenuity is to be found in his <hi>Paſtoral Letter;</hi> where, contrary to his own Sight and Knowledge, he makes King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter to be the Meaſure of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in a moſt prevaricating manner. If any Man beſides himſelf thinks me too raſh or ſevere in this Cenſure, let him but compare that part he hath publiſhed of it, with the whole Charter in Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>'s Hiſtory of King <hi>John,</hi> and conſult what Mr. <hi>L</hi>— hath ſaid upon it, in his excellent Anſwer to his Paſtoral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then if he continues to think ſo, I will retract my Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>The next Inſtance of his Sincerity, is to be found in the 105 Page of the ſecond Part of his <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation;</hi> and I think it a greater Blemiſh to him, and his Hiſtory, than hath been yet noted: But if he pleaſes he may lay the Blame of it too upon the late Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph.</hi> There he tells us of a Project to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> in the Point of the Sacrament, by a <hi>middle Opinion,</hi> in which, he ſaith, <hi>Luther</hi> was willing to have the Difference compoſed. This he pretends to prove from an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal M. S. of <hi>Luther,</hi> in <hi>C. C. C</hi>'s Library in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which he pretends to exemplify in his <hi>Collection,</hi> P. 166. N. 34. but very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly and falſely, as may be ſeen by a true and perfect Copy of the Original in the <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>N.</hi> 11.</note> Appendix <hi>hereunto annexed.</hi> The Reader by comparing them together will find the many Prevarications which he hath uſed to ſet up this <hi>Patern of Comprehenſion.</hi> For firſt, after <hi>CONTRARII</hi> he leaves out <hi>SACRAMENTO,</hi> and inſtead of <hi>Nihil minus</hi> he puts <hi>Nihilominus,</hi> and after <hi>Utile</hi> leaves out <hi>Quam.</hi> A little after, for <hi>Orientur</hi> he puts <hi>Orientium,</hi> leaving a Gap for a Word which he ſaith is wanting, and gueſſes to be <hi>OCCLUDENDI;</hi> whereas there is not the leaſt Sign of a void Space in the Original, and by conſequence no occaſion for Criticiſm or Conjecture. After <hi>Pro futuris,</hi> he leaves out all the Arguments by which <hi>Luther</hi> pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly defends his Opinion; and then for <hi>Conſcientiae bona capti ſunt in Alteram Sententiam,</hi> he puts <hi>Conſcientia bona ſunt in Altera S<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia;</hi> and after <hi>Accedere</hi> he leaves out a great deal in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherein <hi>Luther</hi> declares he could bear with them in hopes of future Communion; but that he could not be of their Belief and Opinion, but he could allow of <hi>Civil</hi> Concord or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, as of Marrying, or Trading with one another. After which again, he expreſſes how ſtrict he was for his own Doctrine, and by conſequence far from a middle trimming Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62198:20"/> which might unite them into one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. He ſeems here, as he ſaith of <note n="(a)" place="margin">In his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillas.</note> 
               <hi>Monſieur Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> to have broken looſe from the common Meaſures of Honeſty and Shame, and to pay his Reader in <hi>falſe Coin,</hi> which he truly tells <hi>Varillas</hi> is more <hi>Criminal in Hiſtory</hi> than in other Matters; and the leaſt I can ſay of this pretended Willingneſs of <hi>Luther</hi> to make up the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thoſe of <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> and them of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by a middle Opinion, is what he ſaith of <hi>Varillas,</hi> That it is all <hi>Viſion,</hi> his <hi>own Invention,</hi> and compoſed out of his own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to ſerve the popular Deſign of <hi>Comprehenſion;</hi> which Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> bemoaned before he took the Oaths, That it was ſtill carried on by our <hi>Latitudinarians,</hi> to the indangering of every Thing that hath been received for Catholick and Fundamental in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in the pureſt Ages of the Church. Indeed Comprehenſion, and in order thereunto an univerſal, unlimited Toleration, was for many Years the great <hi>Diana</hi> of our Funeral Preacher; and thoſe who doubt of this may ſoon ſatisfy themſelves in his old Acquaintance Mr. <hi>Papin</hi>'s <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 410. 414. 419. 420. 421. 422.</note> Book, entitled, <hi>La tolerance des Proteſtants,</hi> &amp;c. in which he vindicates what he had written for Toleration in a former Book, entitled, <hi>La Foi reduite à ſes juſtes bornes,</hi> and a great part of his Vindication of it conſiſts in Copies of Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s Letters, wherein he highly commends the 'foreſaid Book, and another more extravagant in Latin, on the ſame Subject, written by <hi>Strimeſius.</hi> But the horrour <hi>Papin</hi> had of this boundleſs Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which our Church of <hi>England Univerſaliſt</hi> Approved, and which, as he obſerves, ends in abſolute <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> gave him a Pretence of turning <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> to take Sanctuary in the Authority of the Church.</p>
            <p>And now I am upon the Subject of <hi>Latitude,</hi> I will beg leave of the Reader to tell him a Story of Toleration, or Comprehenſion, (for the Difference ſometimes is not great between them) which in the end will touch a little on our Preacher; of whom I muſt obſerve once for all, That it is his Opinion that <note n="(c)" place="margin">Reflections on the Hiſtory of Varillas, p. <hi>7, 8.</hi>

               <hi>an Hiſtorian who favours his own Side is to be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, though he puts a little too much Life in his Colours when he ſets out the beſt Side of his Party, and the worſt of thoſe from whom he differs; and if he but ſlightly touches the Failures of his Friends, and ſeverely aggravates thoſe of the other Side, though in this he departs from the Laws of an exact Hiſtorian,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62198:20"/> yet this Biaſs is ſo Natural, that if it leſſens the Credit of the Writer, yet it doth not blacken him.</hi> This ſhews how apt he is to favour his own Friends, and his own Party, beyond what is juſt and true; and being a known <hi>Latitudinarian,</hi> by his own Rule we can never ſafely truſt him when he commends or defends any of his Friends of that Side. And it was upon the Score of <hi>Latitudinariiſm,</hi> and myſtical Devotion, that he loved to extol Dr. <hi>Layton,</hi> though by ſome Canons he hath cited in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Rights of Princes,</hi> he was an Uſurper of the See of <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> was eſteemed to be in a more offenſive Degree of the See of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But to return to his admired Dr. <hi>Layton,</hi> he was ſo great a Libertine in Comprehenſion, that he freely offered to receive the ejected <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Miniſters without <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Ordination, if they would come in, and to tranſact all Things in the Government of the Church with his <hi>Presbyters</hi> by plurality of Suffrages, ſtrictly ſpeaking as if he were no more than a <hi>Presbyter</hi> among them. Archbiſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> into whoſe Chair he intruded, told Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> this Story of his Intruder; and he wondering that any Biſhop ſhould give up that Power without which he could not act as Biſhop, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> of the truth of it, which he poſitively denied. This denial of his obliged the good Archbiſhop for his Vindication to refer Biſhop <hi>Gunning</hi> to a Book which he had left with a Friend, for the truth of what he had told him of the comprehenſive Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Dr. <hi>Layton.</hi> I ſaw the Book, and remember it was printed at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> and it ſo fully ſatisfied the Biſhop, that he took it home with him; but before he went made ſome Reflections on the want of Ingenuity in Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and concluded his Animadverſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with a Trick he ſhew'd himſelf: It relates to a Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> which the Biſhop intended to anſwer. Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> among others, hearing of it, come to wait upon him; and when that Diſcourſe aroſe between them, he asked the Biſhop upon what Scheme he intended to make his Anſwer. He, who was one of the moſt frank and communicative Men in the World, told him how he would anſwer it from Part to Part; which the Doctor obſerving with Deſign, carried every Thing away, and being a ſwift and ready Writer, printed his Anſwer to it, before the other had finiſhed his.</p>
            <p>I ſaid before that he was alſo an Admirer of <note n="*" place="margin">I ſuppoſe he is the Angelical Man of whom he ſpeaks ſuch hyperbolical Things in the plural Number, and promiſes a particular Account of him in his Pref. before <hi>Bedel</hi>'s Life.</note> Dr. <hi>Layton</hi> upon the Account of myſtical Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he was an Enthuſiaſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62198:21"/> of the firſt magnitude, and it was a great Miſchance, that this Preacher preached not his Funeral Sermon. And as upon that Account he admired him, ſo was he wonderfully taken with <hi>Lab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bades</hi> Writings, and would have perſwaded the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> to ſend for him into <hi>Scotland.</hi> One of his greateſt <hi>London</hi> Friends hath alſo cold me what Pains he, and ſome others, formerly took to correct the Enthuſiaſm of his Temper, and keep him from plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelf into myſtical Divinity: And when he was Profeſſor at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> he was got ſo far into a Fit of it, that he ſet up for an <hi>Aſcetick;</hi> and once, being in the Archbiſhop's Houſe, and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with his Daughter upon ſome common Subject, all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den he leaped out of his Chair, and with a Tone, Look and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, all Extatick and Enthuſiaſtical, ſaid Words to this Effect: <hi>Now am I ſure of my Salvation, now am I ſure, that if the Earth ſhould open and ſwallow me up this moment, my Soul would go to Heaven.</hi> I had this Story from the good Archbiſhop, and I mention it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have obſerved, in very many Inſtances, how Enthuſiaſm with its Religious Heats makes thoſe in whom it is prevalent do the ſame ill Things, that Atheiſm in the ſame degree makes others do. They are indeed Depravations of the Mind very different in their Nature and Theory, but they agree in the ſame unrighteous Practices, and have a tendency to act the ſame Evils. For if the Atheiſt does Evil becauſe he believes not; the Enthuſiaſt will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a thouſand Occaſions believe he may do any Evil. If the one ſticks at no Means, though never ſo wicked, the other thinks the Goodneſs of the End will ſanctify the moſt wicked Means. In a word, They both make a Cloak of Religion for Covetouſneſs, Ambition, and Cruelty: They will both Lye, Murther, Rob, and Rebel for holy Church, and Religion; and there never yet was any Holy League, Covenant or Aſſociation, to begin or carry on Rebellion, under the holy Pretence of Religion, wherein the Ring-leaders were not Atheiſts, or Enthuſiaſts; and of the Two it is hard to tell which hath done moſt Miſchief in any Kingdom, and eſpecially in ours. But the Enthuſiaſt makes the more plauſible and taking Hypocrite of the Two; he can ſooner melt into Tears, and more naturally counterfeit the Spiritual Man among the People, and transform himſelf with a better Grace into an Angel of Light. And one cannot but ſuppoſe that he had a great Doſe of Enthuſiaſm in him, when he undertook to perſwade the late unhappy Princeſs to invade her Father's Kingdom, againſt the Light of Nature, and the Principles of her Education; and that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62198:21"/> he ſeaſon'd his Perſwaſives with the Salt of Phariſaical Tears, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſhed in Commiſeration of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> For it is well known that he hath Tears at Command, as Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts of all Religions have. He wept like any Crocodile at Mr. <hi>Napleton's</hi> Relation of the barbarous Uſage which the King met with at <hi>Feverſham:</hi> And <hi>pray Mr.</hi> Napleton, ſaid he, ſtill wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his Eyes, <hi>carry my Duty to the King, and let him know my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for him.</hi> Which puts me in mind of a Story that I have heard of that Maſter-Enthuſiaſt <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who when a Gentleman came to entreat his <hi>Excellency,</hi> That he would give leave that he might have a Lock of the Beheaded King's Hair for an honourable Lady. Ah! no, Sir, ſaith he, burſting into Tears, that muſt not be; for I ſwore to him, when he was Living, that not an Hair of his Head ſhould Periſh.</p>
            <p>I beg my Reader's Pardon for this Digreſſion of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> though I hope it is not altogether impertinent to my Undertaking, and now return to ſhew by other Examples how apt our Preacher, or Hiſtorian, (call him which you pleaſe) is to write his Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Inventions for true Hiſtory; and that he is very little, if any Thing at all, behind <hi>Varillas</hi> in this Fault, which a Man of Letters, eſpecially a Divine, that deſires to have a laſting Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought to avoid, as much as a Tradeſman that values his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ought to take care not to ſell Counterfeit or Sophiſticated Goods. In his firſt Volume of his <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation, p.</hi> 209. he tells us of Two original Letters, the one in <hi>Italian,</hi> and the other in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> not yet Four years of Age wrote to Queen <hi>Jane Seymour,</hi> when ſhe was with Child of King <hi>Edward;</hi> and that they were both writ in the ſame hand that ſhe wrote all the reſt of her Life. Theſe are Two ſtrange and incredible Things: Firſt, That a Child not yet Four years old ſhould have learned a foreign Language, to ſuch a Degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as to be able to write Letters in it; and Secondly, That ſhe ſhould write then ſo well, as never to mend or alter her hand after. And to theſe Two, I may add thoſe pretty waggiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Letter, which he hath there ſet down with this marginal Note, <hi>Her Letter to the Queen not yet Four years of Age.</hi> In this Letter ſhe Compliments <hi>her Highneſs upon the Pain it was to her to write, her Grace being with Child;</hi> and then after many other Paſſages which could not be the <hi>firſt Bloſſoms</hi> of a Child, as he thinks, theſe Words follow; <hi>I cannot reprove my Lord for not doing your Commendations in his Letter, for he did it; and although he had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62198:22"/> not, yet I will not complain on him, for that he ſhall be diligent to give me knowledg from time to time, how his buſy Child doth; for if I were at his Birth, no doubt I would ſee him beaten for the trouble he hath put you to.</hi> Now I appeal to any conſidering Man, whether thoſe look like the Conceits of a Child not yet Four years old? And none certainly but an Hiſtorian ſo raſh and phanciful in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as he is, would for this Reaſon have thought that this Letter was written to the Queen: And had he taken time enough to reflect, and conſidered his <note n="(a)" place="margin">Q.

               <hi>Honour.</hi> And whether this Diſcovery touches the Reputation of his Underſtanding, or his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour moſt, I leave him to judge.</p>
            <p>From hence I paſs to Biſhop <hi>Bedel</hi>'s Life; of which he ſaith in the Preface, <hi>That his Part in it was ſo ſmall, that he can ſcarce aſſume any Thing to himſelf, but the Copying out of what was put into his Hands by Mr.</hi> Clogy. And in the <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 175.</note> Book he ſaith again, That <hi>Mr.</hi> Clogy <hi>is much more the Author of it than he is.</hi> For this we have only his own Word, which I profeſs ſignifies little with me. But to know what was his, and what Mr. <hi>Clogy</hi>'s, he hath left us to Conjecture; though, I think, few that know his way of Writing will ſo much as doubt that the <hi>Romantick</hi> Paſſages, which I am going to cite out of it, and which are obtruded upon the World for true Hiſtory, are his own Inventions, and not Mr. <hi>Clogy</hi>'s: But however, though they were Mr. <hi>Clogy</hi>'s, he is anſwerable for them for letting them paſs unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and unchaſtiſed into the World. But if they are his own, as I am confident they are, then let Men of the greateſt Candor judge what Cenſure is fit for a Man that would write his own Imaginations for truth; though he had declared in the Preface,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62198:22"/> 
               <hi>That Lives were to be written with the Strictneſs of a ſevere Hiſtorian, and not helped up with Invention;</hi> and that thoſe who do otherwiſe, <hi>dreſs up Legends, and make Lives rather than write them.</hi> To deceive, and at the ſame time to declare againſt deceiving, is double Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture and Impoſition in an Hiſtorian. But Biſhop <hi>Bedel</hi> it ſeems was worthy for whom our Hiſtorian ſhould diſpenſe with the Laws of Hiſtory, as he <note n="(a)" place="margin">13 <hi>Eli.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <hi>did with an Act of Parliament upon a certain Occaſion for reading the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles.</hi> It is manifeſt from the Biſhops Letters, That he was a <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> in ſome Opinions, and from his Life, if it be true written, that he diſliked the uſe of Organs in Divine Service, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the uſe of the Common Prayer in his private Family; and theſe, and ſome other pretended Antipathies to ſome innocent common Practices, tempted our Hiſtorian, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Duty which he ow'd Truth, and his Readers, to dreſs up his Life into a <hi>Romance:</hi> And to give him an heroick Fame, to ſay many Things for his Honour which he knew were not true, or at leaſt was uncertain whether they were, or no. Thus (p. 4) he ſaith, That <hi>his Reputation was ſo great, and ſo well eſtabliſhed, both in the Univerſity and in</hi> Suffolk, <hi>that when King</hi> James <hi>ſent Sir</hi> H. Wootton <hi>to be his Ambaſſador at</hi> Venice, <hi>at the time of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, he was recommended as the fitteſt Man to go Chaplain in ſo critical a Conjuncture.</hi> This ſounds well for his <hi>Hero</hi>'s Honour, had it been reconcilable to Truth; but it neither agrees with the Date of Sir <hi>H. Wootton</hi>'s Credentials, nor the Time of his being in <hi>Venice,</hi> nor of the Interdict, all which ſhews that it was his own Invention, and not matter of Fact: For the Credentials of Sir <hi>H.</hi> bare date in <hi>June,</hi> 1604. after which, in all probability, they got to <hi>Venice</hi> by <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> after; whereas Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the V. who had that Quarrel with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and put them under the Interdict, was not Pope till <hi>May,</hi> 1605. and he did not begin to Threaten and Thunder at them till <hi>September</hi> after, when Sir <hi>Henry</hi> and his Chaplain had been there about a Year. And Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, tranſlated into <hi>Latin</hi> by Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> gives ſo particular an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Time of this Difference, that our Hiſtorian can have no tolerable Excuſe, for ſaying <hi>he was thought the fitteſt Man to go Chaplain in ſo critical a Conjuncture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Pag. 10. he ſaith, <hi>That during his ſtay at</hi> Venice, Ant. de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, <hi>Archbiſhop of</hi> Spalato, <hi>came to</hi> Venice, <hi>and having received a juſt Character of Mr.</hi> Bedel <hi>he diſcovered his Secret to him,</hi> &amp;c. But for God's ſake what Secret? Was it the Secret Deſign of leaving
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62198:23"/> not only his own Country, but all the Papal Dominions, which he ſo often <note n="(a)" place="margin">In his Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium profect.</note> tells us he had thoughts of, for Ten years and upwards, before his putting it in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Or was it the Secret Deſign he had of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Religion, to which the other Deſign was but ſubordinate? But how doth the Diſcovery of theſe Secrets agree with what he ſaith <hi>Conſil profect. Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>That the Call he had was Divine not Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and with calling God and his own Conſcience to witneſs, that no Perſwaſions or Invitations, of what ſort ſoever, had ever reacht his Ears, and that he had uſed no Man's Councel, nor conſulted with any Mortal in that Buſineſs?</hi> The improbability of this Paſſage, be it his, or be it <hi>Clogy</hi>'s, makes me ſuſpect the truth of what follows; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Archbiſhop ſhewed <hi>Bedel</hi> his Ten Books <hi>de Rep. Eccleſiaſtica,</hi> which he afterwards, ſaith he, printed at <hi>London;</hi> and that <hi>Bedel</hi> correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many ill Applications of Texts of Scripture, and Quotations of Fathers in them, all which the Archbiſhop took in good part, and uſed to ſay he could do nothing without him. Page 10, 11, he ſaith, <hi>That a Paſſage fell out during the Interdict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that made greater Noiſe than the Importance of it could perhaps amount to, but it was ſuited to the</hi> Italian <hi>Genius. There came a Jeſuit to</hi> Venice, Thomas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Caraffa, <hi>who Printed a Thouſand Theſes of Philoſophy and Divinity, which he Dedicated to the Pope with this extravagant Inſcription, PAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LO</hi> V. <hi>VICE DEO,</hi> &amp;c. This ſeems very ſtrange, That a Jeſuit ſhould come to <hi>Venice,</hi> and do ſuch bold and provoking Things in the time of the <hi>Interdict,</hi> when the whole Order had quitted the <hi>Venetian</hi> Dominions; and the State was ſo ſevere as to ſhut the Door upon them, and to keep them out at the Time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, though great Endeavours were uſed to the contrary. This I ſay ſeems very ſtrange; but to put the whole Matter out of all Diſpute, Firſt, This fell not out during the Interdict, but in 1608. whereas the <hi>Interdict</hi> was at an end in the beginning of 1607. as appears from the Hiſtory of it. Secondly, <hi>Thomas Maria Caraffa</hi> was not a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> but a <hi>Dominican.</hi> Thirdly, He came not to <hi>Venice,</hi> but Printed his Theſes at <hi>Naples,</hi> and at <hi>Rome;</hi> and Copies of them were ſent as Novels from <hi>Rome,</hi> and did the more amuſe the <hi>Venetians,</hi> becauſe of the Controverſy that State had with the Pope a little before. All this he might have ſeen in <hi>Bedel</hi>'s Letters to <hi>Waddeſworth,</hi> p. 365, 366, 367. And whereas he alſo writes in the forecited Place of his Life, That Mr. <hi>Bedel</hi> obſerving the numeral Letters of the Words, <hi>PAULO</hi> V. <hi>VICE DEO</hi> to make 666. the Number of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62198:23"/> his Obſervation to P. <hi>Paulo,</hi> and the Seven Divines, and that they carried it to the Duke, and Senate, who entertained it, as if it had come from Heaven. He himſelf, in the forecited Place of his Letters to Mr. <hi>Waddeſworth,</hi> ſaith no ſuch Thing; but only <hi>that the New Title</hi> Vice Deo, <hi>and that of Omnipotency, gave matter of Wonder; and that the next day it was noiſed about the City, that the Picture of the Pope, under which it was written, was the Picture of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; for that the Inſcription,</hi> Paulo <hi>V.</hi> Vice Deo, <hi>contained exactly in the numeral Letters the Number of the Beaſt in the</hi> Revelation, 666. But to prevent the Amuſement which might otherwiſe ariſe in the Mind of the Reader, about this imperſonal way of Mr. <hi>Bedel</hi>'s tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Story of that ingenious Obſervation, he tells, he was too modeſt a Man to claim the Diſcovery of it. But Sir <hi>H. Wootton</hi> aſſured King <hi>James,</hi> that he firſt obſerved it: But how ſhall we be aſſured that Sir <hi>Henry</hi> told the King ſo? I profeſs his wilful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes about <hi>Caraffa,</hi> and his Theſes by which he contradicts both the Hiſtory of the Interdict, and Mr. <hi>Bedel</hi>'s own Account of the Fact, makes me notwithſtanding doubt of this Particular, and here Query, having as yet no other Authority for it, Whether it be true, or no?</p>
            <p>Pages 12, 13, 14, 15, he is ſo impudent as to build up the Fame and Reputation of Mr. <hi>Bedel</hi> upon the Infamy of Sir <hi>Henry Wootton</hi> his Patron, contrary to Truth, and the Juſtice that is due to the Memory of that great and good Man. <q>Here, ſaith he, I muſt add a Paſſage, concerning which I am in doubt, <hi>whether it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected more on the Sincerity, or on the Underſtanding</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador. The Breach between the Pope and the Republick was brought very near a Criſis; ſo that it was expected a total Separation not only from the Court, but the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was likely to follow it. It was ſet on by Pope <note n="(a)" place="margin">This is but a ſlight Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; but becauſe it is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated; it ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of: For <hi>P.</hi> Paulo was himſelf one of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there being but Six em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Senate beſides.</note> 
                  <hi>Paulo,</hi> and the Seven Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, with much Zeal, and was very prudently conducted by them. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the advancing of it, King <hi>James</hi> ordered his Ambaſſador to offer all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Aſſiſtance, and to accuſe the Pope, and the Papacy, as the chief Authors of all the Miſchiefs of Chriſtendom.— P. <hi>Paulo,</hi> and the Seven Divines, preſſed Mr. <hi>Bedel</hi> to move the Ambaſſador to preſent King <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>PREMONITION TO ALL CHRISTIAN PRINCES AND STATES,</hi> then put in <hi>Latin</hi> to the Senate, and they were confident it would produce a great Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62198:24"/> But the Ambaſſador could not be prevailed with to do it at that Time, and pretended that ſince St. <hi>James</hi>'s day was not far off, it would be more proper to do it on that day. If this was only for the ſake of a Speech that he had made on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Day, and King <hi>James</hi>'s Book, with which he had pretended to preſent it, <hi>it was a Weakneſs never to be excuſed:</hi> But if this was only a <hi>Pretence,</hi> and that there was a <hi>Deſign</hi> under it, <hi>it was a Crime never to be forgiven.</hi> All that <hi>Bedel</hi> could ſay or do, to perſwade him not to put off a Thing of ſuch Importance, was in vain; and indeed I can hardly think that <hi>Wootton</hi> was ſo <hi>weak a Man as to have acted Sincerely in this Matter.</hi> Before St. <hi>James</hi>'s Day came — the Difference was made up, and the happy Opportunity was loſt; ſo that when he had his Audience on that Day, in which he preſented the Book, all the Anſwer he could get was, That they thanked the King of <hi>England</hi> for his good Will, but they were now reconciled to the Pope. It may be eaſily imagined what a Wound this was to his Chaplain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Behold here a Story as falſe, as formal; and great pity it is that Sir <hi>H. Wootton</hi>'s Heir, if any ſuch be alive now to repreſent him, ſhould not have the Benefit of an Action againſt our Hiſtorian, to repair the Honour of his Anceſtor, which is ſo deeply wounded by him. For if this Story were punctually true, it would not bear the ſevere Reflections which he hath made upon Sir <hi>H.</hi> for it; becauſe he might not think fit to follow his Chaplain's Advice without order from the King his Maſter, which he might hope to receive before St. <hi>James</hi>'s Day; and yet for private Reaſons not think ſit to tell his Chaplain the Reaſon of his Delay. But the Story muſt needs be falſe; becauſe the King's Book, of which he makes mention, was not then extant. For the Pope and the <hi>Venetians</hi> were reconciled in <note n="(a)" place="margin">Bed. Hiſt. of the Ven. Interd. p. <hi>218.</hi>

               <hi>April,</hi> 1607. and the King's <hi>Premonition</hi> came not out till 1609. Nor will it help him to ſay, That this was only a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of the <hi>Premonition</hi> for the Apology, which was Reprinted with it, and to which, in the King's own Phraſe, it was a <hi>Preamble.</hi> For the firſt Edition of the <hi>Apology</hi> was as little extant before the Reconciliation mentioned, as the <hi>Premonition.</hi> For that which occaſioned the King's Writing the Apology, as himſelf tells us, was the Two <hi>Breves</hi> ſent over by the Pope, and Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Letter; and the later of the <hi>Breves</hi> bears date from <hi>Rome</hi> but in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 23, 1607. and the Letter <hi>September</hi> 28, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: By which it appears that the <hi>Reconciliation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> was made ſeveral
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62198:24"/> Months before either of theſe were written, and longer before they could come to the King's hand, longer yet before he could finiſh the Apology in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and again longer before it could be put into <hi>Latin.</hi> From whence it appears, That this fine told Story, which ſo diſhonours the Memory of Sir <hi>H.

            <p>But to go on with the Inventions of our Hiſtorian, p. 17. he ſaith, That P. <hi>Paulo might never be forgot by</hi> Bedel <hi>he gave him his Picture — the invaluable Manuſcript of the Hiſtory of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Hiſtory of the Interdict, and of the Inquiſition.</hi> No Body doubts of <hi>Father Paul</hi>'s, Kindneſs to Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> but it will appear that theſe Tokens of it are more than queſtionable from what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: Firſt, as to his Picture, he that reads his Life will ſcarce believe he was ſo forward to give his Picture, or that he had it to give. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Life of Father Paul.

               <hi>For he would never let his Picture be drawn from the Natural, notwithſtanding it were deſired by Kings, and great Princes. And although many of his Pictures go abroad for Originals, yet they are all but Copies of one which is ſaid to be in the Gallery of a great King, which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt his Will, and by a Stratagem. But for himſelf this may give Aſſurance, that he did not endure to have his Picture drawn; becauſe in the laſt Years of his Life, being intreated by the moſt illuſtrious and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> Dominico Molin, <hi>and likewiſe by his Confident</hi> Fra.

Laſtly, for the Hiſtory of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> there are ſome Paſſages in it which ſhew plainly, That it was not then in Being: For there is mention made in it, not only of Things which happen'd in 1610. juſt upon the return of Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> but alſo 1607. which appears not to be a Miſtake in the Print by a Character there added, that it was 48 Years after 1569. which makes the Year 1610. Page 18. he ſaith, <hi>When</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del <hi>came over he brought along with him the Archbiſhop of</hi> Spalata, <hi>and one</hi> Deſpoline <hi>a Phyſitian, who could no longer bear with the Corruptions of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church,</hi> &amp;c. It was in the Year 1610. that Mr. <hi>Bedel</hi> return'd with Sir. <hi>H. Wootton</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and the bringing them over ſhould in all Reaſon and Decency have been aſcribed to the Ambaſſador, rather than his Chaplain; but having ſet him up for a Man that had his own Dislikes to bowing at the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the alternative Reading and Singing of Pſalms, bowing towards the Altar, inſtrumental Muſick in Churches, and the uſe of the Common Prayer in private Families, he was reſolved to paint him with a Glory, and tranſmit his Memory to after Ages by Fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well as true Stories, and even rob his Patron of his due Praiſes to extol him.

But to apply all to the Purpoſe of my own Writing; if he hath taken ſuch Poetical Liberties where he promiſed to write with <hi>the Severity of a ſtrict Hiſtorian,</hi> and <hi>to give only a bare and ſimple Relation of Things;</hi> I ſay, if he hath taken ſuch Liberties, and made ſo bold with Truth, in the <hi>Life of one Biſhop,</hi> contrary to his own Promiſes, I think we cannot be too cautious how we believe him in his <hi>Funeral Sermon</hi> upon the other; although he profeſſes to ſpeak of him with <hi>Plaineſs and Simplicity,</hi> with <hi>great Reſerves,</hi> and with <hi>a Modeſty of Stile through his whole Diſcourſe.</hi> But I think I have ſhewed how little Profeſſions of this Nature ſignify, when they come from him; and will only add, That our bleſſed Saviour's Advice of taking heed whom and what we hear, is very ſtrictly to be obſerved then when we hear or read him, who is ſo apt to Romance, and to ſpeak of Things and Perſons as he would have them to be, rather than as they are: And that he hath ſo ſpoken in many Reſpects of Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> and praiſed him above his Merits, and more than his Memory deſerves, is according to the Method of the mentioned Conference which I propoſed to follow, to be the Subject <hi>of the enſuing Chapter.</hi>

            <p>AMong the many worthy Men of our Church, whoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories have been tranſmitted to Poſterity, we read of ſome who have forbidden Sermons to be preached at their Funerals; of others, who have forbidden that any mention ſhould be made of them in their Funeral Sermons; and others again have taken care to nominate Perſons to preach at their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, in whoſe great Prudence and Judgment they had an entire Confidence, that they would ſpeak more to the Living than of the Dead; and that what they ſpoke of them would be Juſt, Modeſt, and Genuin; and ſuch as they might have ſaid of themſelves without Arrogance had they been Living, or heard others ſay of them without Confuſion. Had Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> been ſo careful as to follow any one of theſe Examples, or his Friends ſo well adviſed as to follow them for him, he would have had more reſt in his Grave, and perhaps not had his Name ſo ſoon, and ſo ſtrictly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into queſtion: But having had the Misfortune after his Death to have his Funeral Sermon preached by a Man who hath ſhewed ſo little Temper and Juſtice in his Character, but raiſed his Fame to an undue Pitch upon the Defamation of others more worthy than he; I thought I ſhould do a Work acceptable to all Lovers of Truth, and of the true Church of <hi>England,</hi> if I ſhewed in ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances how undeſerving he was of that Character; and by noting ſome of his defects, which ought to be noted, prevent the Danger which unwary Readers, and Hearers of his Funeral Sermon, might otherwiſe fall into, of following him upon the implicit Belief of this Character, in the Wrong as well as in the Right, and walk after him as ſecurely in the devious paths of Errour, as in the ſtrait way of Truth.

               <hi>kept the ſacred Truſt of the Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine, and maintain'd it pure and undefiled</hi> to his dying Day? This is the lofty Character which our Preacher hath given us of Dr. <hi>T.</hi> but falſely, and ſo much above his Merit, That he hath had the deplorable Infelicity to do
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62198:26"/> many Things contrary to every part of it, as I ſhall ſhew in ſome ſignal Inſtances; which were <hi>blemiſhes</hi> in his Life, and will remain ſuch Blots upon his Memory, as no Apology will ever be able to waſh out</p>
            <p>My firſt Inſtance ſhall be in his Apoſtacy from his own avowed Principle and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the once vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Doctrine of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> or <hi>Paſſive Obedience;</hi> in which our Church hath taught her Children how they ſhould behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards Men, and approve themſelves towards God, if ſhe and they ſhould come to be perſecuted for the Tryal of their Faith, as the pureſt Churches and beſt Chriſtians have been in former Ages. He did not only <note n="(a)" place="margin">In his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to the Book of Homilies.</note> ſubſcribe to the Truth of this Doctrine, and in the Profeſſion of the Truth of it, declare it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to take up Arms againſt the King upon any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatſoever;</hi> but preſſed it upon the Conſciences of Living and Dying Men: And when he preached againſt Popery, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it not only in the moſt ſerious manner that good Divines uſe to do the moſt important matters of Chriſtiany, but with that <hi>Strength and Clearneſs,</hi> which, our Preacher ſaith, <hi>is his peculiar Talent.</hi>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62198:27"/> means by which it was brought about. <hi>We muſt not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>here forget the many Worthies of our Nation, who did ſo generouſly run all hazards of Life and Fortune, for the Preſervation of our Religion, and the Aſſerting our Ancient Laws and Liberties.</hi> Behold the Preacher at <hi>Lincolns Inn,</hi> and the Confeſſor in <hi>Lincolns Inn Fields,</hi> contradicting one another. The Confeſſor told my Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> That <hi>the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion plainly forbids the Reſiſtance of Authority,</hi> and that <hi>the ſame Law which eſtabliſhed our Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> declares it not lawful to take up Arms upon any Pretence whatſoever.</hi> But the Preacher, now turned Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate from the Confeſſor, commends the many Worthies, as he calls the Traytors and Rebels of our Country, for ſoliciting a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince, and the Creature of another State, to invade their own Sovereign's Dominions, and aſſiſting of him in the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, till they had driven him out of his Kingdoms. He ſaith, It was generouſly done of them to run all hazards of Life and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and he might have added of their Salvation too, for the Preſervation of our Religion and Liberties; although he had told the World before, that our Laws forbid the Preſervation of them by thoſe means; nay, <hi>that the Laws of Nature, and the Rules of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had not left us at Liberty to uſe them;</hi> which was in effect to ſay, That neither our Laws would have our Religion, nor our Religion have it ſelf preſerved, by the Means thoſe Worthies uſed for its Preſervation. The Belief of the Lawfulneſs of Reſiſting, when our Rights and Liberties ſhould be invaded, was <hi>a Sin of a dangerous and heinous Nature in my Lord</hi> Ruſſel; but the Practice of it was laudable in I know not how many Lords and Gentlemen more, for preſerving our Religion, Laws, and Liberties by it; and if any of them ſince are gone out of the World in a <hi>Deluſion and falſe Peace,</hi> he is one of thoſe Divines who more eſpecially muſt Anſwer to God for it. For it was after a cloſe Conſult with him, and one or two more, that a Motion was made in the Houſe of Lords for <hi>Appointing a Day of Thankſgiving to God for having made his Highneſs P. O. the glorious Inſtrument of delivering this Kingdom from Popery and Arbitrary Power:</hi> And then it was that our <hi>Engliſh Worthies,</hi> as well as the <hi>Heroe</hi> under whom they acted, were applauded in the Pulpits for the Succeſs of that Glorious Enterprize, which to think or ſpeak of in a ſlighting manner, <hi>was,</hi> in his Opinion, <hi>to be guilty of the fouleſt and blackeſt Ingratitude both to God, and them.</hi>

               <hi>As for Religion, the very Heathens always ſpoke of it as the great Band of human Society, and the Foundation of Truth, and Fidelity, and Juſtice, among Men. But when Religion once comes to ſupplant moral Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to teach Men the abſurdeſt Things in the World, to Lye for the Truth, and to Kill Men for God's ſake; when it ſerves to no other Purpoſe, but to be a Bond of Conſpiracy to inflame the Tempers of Men to a greater Fierceneſs, and to ſet a keener Edge upon their Spirits, and to make them ten times more the Children of Wrath and Cruelty than they were by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; then ſurely it loſes its Nature, and ceaſes to be Religion: For let any Man ſay worſe of Atheiſm and Infidelity if he can. And for God's ſake what is Religion good for, but to reform the Manners and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, to reſtrain human Nature from Violence and Cruelty, from Falſhood and Treachery, from Sedition and Rebellion? Better it were there were no revealed Religion; and that human Nature were left to the Conduct of its own Principles and Inclinations—then to be acted by a Religion which inſpires Men with ſo wild a Fury, and prompts them to commit ſuch Outrages, and is continually ſupplanting Government, and undermining the Welfare of Mankind. In ſhort, ſuch a Religion that teaches Men to propagate and advance</hi> (and he might have added, preſerve) <hi>its ſelf by means ſo evidently contrary to the very Nature and End of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s fam'd Character of Religion; and not to deſcant in long Applications upon it, I deſire my Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if it is not as applicable to the New as to the Old Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> and the <hi>Worthies</hi> of the Proteſtants, as well as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion, who conſpired againſt <hi>James</hi> the Second, as theſe did againſt <hi>James</hi> the Firſt. Tell me, O ye Worthies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have hazarded your Lives and Fortunes to preſerve our Religion, Is it more lawful to Plot and Rebel for holy Church of <hi>England,</hi> than for holy Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> And is it not as much <hi>Prieſtcraft</hi> in our Divines to applaud you as <hi>Worthies</hi> for ſo doing, as it was in the Pope to compare the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and his Partizans, to thoſe Jewiſh Worthies, <hi>Jephtha, Gideon,</hi> and the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and do you not deſpiſe them for their ſordid Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of you in open Contradiction to their own Doctrines, and the Principles of that Religion which they pretend ſtill to profeſs;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62198:28"/> May I not ſay with Dr. <hi>Till.</hi> againſt himſelf,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Serm. Vol. <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>77.</hi>
               </note> That <hi>a Miracle is not enough to give Credit to a Man who teaches Things ſo contrary to the Nature of Religion, and that</hi>

            <p>But this is but one Inſtance of acting in contradiction to his own Doctrine, when the appointed time of tryal came; there are many more ſo well known, that I need not mention them: For indeed his whole Practice ſince the Revolution hath been one Series of Apoſtacy, and by which he hath not only diſhonoured his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and made all his other Good be evil ſpoken of, but been a Scandal to our holy Church and Religion, to which our Preacher ſaith, he was <hi>ſuch an Honour;</hi> given the Enemies of them great occaſion to Triumph, their beſt and moſt ſtedfaſt Friends great occaſion of Grief and Shame: And laſtly, tempted looſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled Men to turn Atheiſts, and ridicule our Prieſthood and Religion; and this he hath been told of in ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manners, that I do not wonder <note n="(c)" place="margin">Fun.

            <p>I cannot imagine but that one Letter which was ſent to his Lady for him, ſuperſcribed for Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> muſt needs diſquiet him very much, if he received it, and read it.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62198:28"/> how you reconcile them with the Poſitions and Intentions of that Letter, and conſequently whether you have a Belief of God, and the World to come.— <note n="(a)" place="margin">

Your own good Name calls for it,</hi> and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe you have accepted <hi>a moſt Reverend and Devout Man's Archbiſhoprick.</hi> A Man who hath given Evidence how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably he is a Proteſtant. <hi>A Sufferer formerly for the Laws, and Church of</hi> England; <hi>and a Sufferer for thoſe very Principles upon which that Letter to my Lord was written, for thoſe very Principles which you diſputed for, when he had ſo ſhort a time to Live:</hi> Nay, which you remember'd him of even upon the Scaffold, with the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Commination of eternal Woe.

            <p>The Gentleman who wrote this Letter to Dr. <hi>T.</hi> is a Perſon of great Candour and Integrity, and was once a great Admirer of him; and from his Example we may ſee what a mighty Scandal the Doctor's Apoſtacy hath been to the very Notion of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as well as that profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And I have heard him ſay, ſince Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Death, that he thinks he was an Atheiſt, as much as a Man could be, though the <hi>graveſt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>certainly that ever was;</hi> and this Opinion, which this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and many others have of him is owing to that great and ſcandalous Blemiſh of his Life, his Apoſtacy from his own Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines about <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> and the <hi>Nature of Religion;</hi> and this foul Blemiſh which hath tempted that ſerious and worthy Gentleman, and others, to queſtion Religion it ſelf upon his Account, is like to be an everlaſting Blot upon his Memory, unleſs his Funeral Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Pain,</hi> who have mentioned him in their Sermons with ſo much Reſpect, will pleaſe to write a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on purpoſe to reconcile the Contradiction between his late Practice, and former Principles and Precepts, which he himſelf, though called on in ſo ſolemn a manner, had not the Hardineſs to do. I beg Mr. <hi>Manningham</hi>'s, who is one of his Doctors, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for not mentioning of him among the others; for he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps hath found out a way to reconcile them, becauſe he <hi>Sainted</hi> him in his Prayer before the Sermon, which he preached to the Sons of the Clergy-men at <hi>Bow:</hi> But if he is pleaſed to undertake a Diſcourſe of that Nature, he muſt take care not to forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; who in a Sermon at the <hi>Rolls,</hi> while the <hi>Convention</hi> was a ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62198:29"/> ſaid, That <hi>a Convention of Engliſh Subjects could no more make a King, than a Convention of Atoms make the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which gave the great Offence to the Gentleman, whoſe Letter I have cited, was the Inconſiſtency of the Doctor's Practices with his Principles ſince the Revolution; to which I muſt further add, That his Practices long before it were not well reconcilable with them, nor they with his Practices: And of this I will give one Inſtance, and that was his great Intimacy with the late Lord <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> and particularly about that time when he preached on the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> 1678. and his Acting in conſort with him then in upholding the Pretenſions of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to be the King's Legitimate Son, and giving credit to thoſe innumerable Lyes which were invented at <hi>Thanet Houſe</hi> to ſupport the Credit of the <hi>Popiſh Plot.</hi> I queſtion very much whether more Lyes and Calumnies againſt the King and the Government were then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed from his, or my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Houſe: I have particular Reaſon for what I ſay; for I was then well acquainted with a Perſon who was very intimate with one of his Favourite Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, to whom he uſed to go very often, in great kindneſs to diſabuſe his Credulity, and confute thoſe Stories which he uſed to hear in <hi>Amen Corner</hi> often to his diſturbance. He was pleaſed to call that Gentleman his <hi>Sive,</hi> becauſe he was wont to ſeparate the Tares from the Wheat, and the Bran from the Flour of his Stories; and by converſing with him, I came to know more of the great Intercourſe and Correſpondency there was between my <hi>Lord Shaftsbury,</hi> and the <hi>Dean of Canterbury,</hi> than was commonly known. The Dean uſed to go in thoſe Days Three or Four times a Week to my Lord's Houſe, but very privately; and there often met a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others one of his Relations, a great Lord of the Court, whom I think not fit to Name. My Lord <hi>D.</hi> who was then committed to the Tower, by the Malice of his Enemies, knew well how much the Dean was in their Intereſts, and particularly the great Eſteem he was in among thoſe who were the Confidents at <hi>Thanet Houſe.</hi> This obliged his Lordſhip to write to him to entreat him to do him all the good Offices he could among that Party: The Dean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this went to wait upon his Lordſhip in the Tower; but how far he engaged in that Negotiation for my Lord's Service, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now remember, but the Event ſhew'd that there was little Effect of it.</p>
            <p>Remembering theſe Stories, and the many ſlanderous Reports that had come from his Houſe, and uſed to be told upon his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62198:30"/> againſt the King and Government, I was curious to ſee his Sermon againſt <hi>Evil Speaking,</hi> upon <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2. which was occaſioned by ſome ill Reports and Reflections that went abroad of himſelf, and <hi>this Government</hi> more eſpecially, in the unlicenſed Prints of the Times. There I was very much pleaſed to find him condemning <hi>Evil Speaking, as a deteſtable Vice; whether it were by being the firſt Authors of ill Reports, or by relating them from others; by ſpeaking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Man's Face, or behind his Back, directly or obſcurely, by way of Inſinuation, by down-right Reproach, or with a Preface of Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. More eſpecially was I pleaſed, and aſtoniſhed withal, to find him ſetting forth the heinous Nature of <hi>reviling thoſe whom God hath placed in Authority, and to ſlander the Footſteps of the Lord's Anointed.</hi> I could not but admire the Power of Conſcience, and of Divine Truth, to extort this from a Man who had been ſo guilty of it, as you ſhall find by the following Story.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles the Second</hi> taking Notice of the falſe and ſcandalous Report of his Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Mother, made a Declaration on the Sixth of <hi>January,</hi> 1679. written with his own Hand, in theſe Words following. — <hi>I do here declare, in the Preſence of Almighty God, that I never was Married, nor gave any Contract to any Woman whatſoever, but to my Wife Queen</hi> Catherine, <hi>to whom I am now Married.</hi> This Declaration was made in the Preſence of <hi>W. Cant. H. Finch,</hi> C. <hi>H. Coventry, J. Williamſon.</hi> In <hi>March</hi> following his Majeſty made a more publick Declaration in the Privy Council, to ſtrengthen the former, in theſe Words. — <hi>For the avoiding any Diſpute which may happen in time to come, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Succeſſion to the Crown, I do here declare, in the Preſence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that I never made, nor gave any Contract of Marriage, nor was Married to any Woman whatſoever, but to my preſent Wife Queen</hi> Catherine <hi>now Living.</hi> Whitehall <hi>the Third of</hi> March, 1679. This Declaration, atteſted by Sixteen Privy Counſellers; was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Council Book, and Copies of it quickly got abroad; and as it came to Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Hands ſooner we may be ſure than moſt Men's; ſo he had the Ingenuity to note it for an Equivocal Declaration: As if the King, contrary to the Punctation of it, and the common Uſage of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Speech, had meant it in this Senſe; <hi>I do here declare, in the Preſence of Almighty God, that I never made, nor gave any Contract of Marriage, nor was Married to any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whatſoever NOW LIVING, but to my preſent Wife Queen</hi> Catherine. I had this Story from one whom I ſhall Name if cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62198:30"/> upon for it, to whom he made this Obſervation; and though I never mentioned it to any Perſon till very lately, yet the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was whiſpered about, and coming to the King's Ears, with other additional Rumours concerning his Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Mother; he ſet out a Declaration <hi>June</hi> the 8. 1680. in which, after a <note n="(a)" place="margin">Lond. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, N. <hi>1519.</hi>
               </note> Recital of his two former Declarations, are theſe Words: <hi>And we do again call God Almighty to Witneſs, and declare upon the Faith of a Chriſtian, and the Word of a King, That there was never any Marriage, or Contract of Marriage, had or made between us, and the ſaid Mrs.</hi> Walters, <hi>alias</hi> Barlow, <hi>the Duke of</hi> Monmouth<hi>'s Mother, nor between us and any Woman whatſoever, our Royal Conſort Queen</hi> Catherine <hi>that now is only excepted.</hi> This laſt Declaration put an end to this Calumny, which I think was ſlandering the Lord's Anointed, and back-biting him with a Witneſs; as I think alſo what he ſaith of the <hi>French</hi> King, in his Thankſgiving Sermon for the <hi>late Victory</hi> at Sea, may juſtly be eſteemed. There he compares him to Lucifer, and taxeth him of Pride, Preſumption, ſottiſh Ignorance; of Tyranny, Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Injuſtice, and of Cruelty; more barbarous than ever the moſt barbarous Nations did commit; and all this in manifeſt repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and contradiction to the Sermon he had preached againſt <hi>Evil Speaking,</hi> in which he taxeth all Parties that <hi>love to blaſt the Reputation of their Adverſaries, and eſpecially thoſe that are of a different Religion.</hi> But all this of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> whom his own Subjects ſtile the <hi>Juſt,</hi> and the <hi>Great,</hi> is nothing in compariſon to the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Slanders with which he hath loaded his own Sovereign, both before and ſince the Revolution.

I am not able to expreſs the <hi>Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of this complex Injury to the King, the Queen, and the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Miſchiefs that have thereupon enſued to the Three Kingdoms: And this Heroick and Unblemiſhed Man of Piety, for any Thing we know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, went out of the World without any Remorſe for it; at leaſt without ſuch a penitential Remorſe, as brought him to make what Satisfaction he was able to God and the King for it: And let our Preacher ſay what he pleaſes now, or hereafter, when he brings forth his <hi>Reſerves,</hi> this is ſuch a Stain and Blemiſh in his Life, as he with all his Arts and Artifices will never be able to get out. He tells us, He had <hi>no Burthen on his Conſcience on his Death Bed:</hi> No more had his Uncle <hi>Cromwel;</hi> and I proteſt conſidering theſe Things, and his Intruſion into the Archbiſhop's Throne, and that long train of Sins that followed thereupon, one would almoſt be tempted to fear that he died in <hi>Deluſion and falſe Peace of Conſcience,</hi> or that his Belief of his own Doctrine of <hi>Hell Torments</hi> gave his Mind eaſe.</p>
            <p>This brings me to another Blemiſh of his Life, and that is, his Sermon of the Eternity of Hell Torments, upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.46. which the Reader may find in the Fourth Volume of his Sermons. In this Sermon, as he openly and directly writes againſt the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Hell Torments;</hi> ſo covertly he undermines the Doctrine of Chriſt's Satisfaction, by aſſerting, <note n="(b)" place="margin">

I tell this the rather to provoke the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62198:32"/> to purge themſelves of the Scandal this Sermon hath raiſed upon them, by a publick Cenſure of it; their own Honour, and the Honour of the Church, and the Care they have of Peoples Souls, obligeth them to do it. Nay, the People have a Right to demand and require it in God's Name of them; and the not doing of it, I think in my Conſcience, will be ſuch an heinous Sin of omiſſion, as may juſtly provoke God to forſake the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as he forſook the Seven <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, and make it as deſolate as them. Nay, furthermore I dare be bold to ſay, That had this Man lived in that Age when the Biſhops roſe up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> for his Blaſphemies, they would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him for his. For to apply the Words of the Apoſtle upon another Occaſion, If Chriſt, the great Doctor and Legiſlator of his Church, and Judg of all Men at the laſt Day, after all his Doctrines and Threatnings concerning Hell-Torments, is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to execute them accordingly, then is your Preaching, O ye Clergy vain, and our Faith vain; yea, and you are found falſe Witneſſes of God, becauſe you have teſtified that he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict eternal Torments, although he is free to do what he will, and may pleaſe whether he will inflict them, or no. This is the natural Reflection which every Clown will make upon the Clergy upon this Man's Doctrine of Hell Torments; and therefore it is to be hoped they will make haſte to Anathematize it, and that there is more than ordinary Cauſe for them to do ſo, will appear from this following Story, which I had from a Learned Clergy-man of great Sincerity, concerning the Secret of this damnable Opinion. The firſt Author of it among us was an <hi>old Sceptick</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who wrote a Book of the Subject, which he uſed to put into the hands of others to proſelyte them to his Opinion. When he put it into the hands of this Clergy-man, upon whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I tell this Story, he proteſted to him, That he had Converted Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> and Five or Six Divines more, moſt of which are now in great Places of the Church. I wiſh I could have ſeen that Treatiſe of his, to compare it with this Sermon of <hi>Hell Torments;</hi> and then I ſhould have ſeen whether the Author of it borrowed it thence, as ſome of his Friends have aſſured me he borrowed his <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi>'s <hi>Sure Foooing,</hi> from the Diſcourſes of the Learned Dr. <hi>Cradock,</hi> who deſigned to anſwer that Book.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid a great deal on the Occaſion of this wretched Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; but one Thing more I muſt Remark, and it is this:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62198:32"/>
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 156.</note> He tells us, That if God intended his Threatnings of <hi>Hell Torments</hi> ſhould have their Effects to deter Men from Sinning, it cannot be imagined that in the ſame Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which declares theſe Threatnings, any intimation ſhould be given of the Abatement or Non-execution of them. But for God's ſake, what need God be ſo careful not to intimate that which this Man could find out? Or why would it weaken his Laws more, or take off the Edge and Terrour of his Threatnings, for him to intimate this Abatement, than for his Miniſters to do it? And therefore to turn his own Concluſion in his own Phraſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf; Was it not <hi>a very impious Deſign</hi> in him, and <hi>a betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men into miſery,</hi> not only to intimate this Abatement, but to teach it, and by Arguments in a ſet Diſcourſe to go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men into a Belief of it? Had he lived in the Days of that Great and Apoſtolick Archbiſhop, whoſe Works he hath Licenſed to be publiſhed with the juſt and glorious Title of <hi>Martyr,</hi> he and his Sermon had not paſſed ſo free from Cenſure. Oh may that Engliſh <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Primitive Apoſtolical Spirit of Orthodoxy and Diſcipline fall upon our Engliſh Clergy, that God may bleſs them, and delight to do them and the Church good; and make them as much the Veneration and Glory, as latitude in Projects and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, looſneſs in Diſcipline, and departing in Practice from their Principles, have made them the Scorn and Contempt of the World.</p>
            <p>From his Sermon on <hi>Hell Torments,</hi> I paſs to that preached at <hi>Whitehall</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 1680. upon <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24.15. In which the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſage, though levelled at the Papiſts, gave great Offence to very many both of the Church and Diſſenting Communions. <q>I cannot think till I be better informed (which I am always ready to be) that any Pretence of Conſcience warrants any Man, that is not extraordinarily Commiſſioned, as the Apoſtles and firſt Publiſhers of the Goſpel were, and cannot juſtify that Commiſſion by Miracles, as they did to affront the Eſtabliſhed Religion of a Nation, although it be falſe, and openly draw Men off from the Profeſſion of it, in contempt of the Magiſtrate and the Laws. All that Perſons of a different Religion can in ſuch a Caſe reaſonably pretend to, is to enjoy the private Liberty and Exerciſe of their own Conſciences and Religion, for which they ought to be very thankful; and to forbear the open making of Proſelytes to their own Religion (though they be never ſo ſure they are in the Right) till they have either an extraordinary
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62198:33"/> Commiſſion from God to that purpoſe, or the Providence of God make way for it, by the Commiſſion or Connivance of the Magiſtrate.</q> This is down-right <hi>Hobbiſm;</hi> and a witty Lord ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the King's Elbow when he ſpake it, ſaid, Sir, Sir, do you hear Mr <hi>Hobs</hi> in the Pulpit? In truth, according to this Doctrine, there's no ſtemming the Torrent of any Errour, or Irreligion; no not of Idolatry it ſelf, when it happens to be Regnant, and get the Civil Sanction: And it ſeverely reflects not only upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Orthodox Biſhops and Clergy in the <hi>Arian</hi> Reigns, but on the Memory of the moſt celebrated Reformers in moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. And ſhould God permit Popery to get but one Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, how <hi>Bribed</hi> and <hi>Penſionary</hi> ſoever in this Nation, our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy by this Doctrine would have nothing to do, but to pray at home, and deliver up their Flocks to the Wolves. Dr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> the good and learned Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> was ſo ſenſible of this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that he complained loudly of it in the Houſe of Lords, as a Doctrine that would ſerve the Turn of Popery; and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent is it with, and deſtructive of the Rights of the Church, as a Society diſtinct from the State, and independent of it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Times of Perſecution, when it muſt ſtand upon its own Rights, That it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned <note n="(a)" place="margin">Dr. Lowth of the Subject of Church Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in whom it reſides, its force, extent, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.

The Place I mean is Page 9. There the very Exiſtence of a God may be thought to be called into queſtion by him, and to be in his account but a Politick Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For thus he writes, preſſing Religion as the ſtrongeſt Band of human Society; <hi>God is ſo neceſſary to the Happineſs and Welfare of Mankind, as if the Being of God himſelf had been purpoſely deſigned
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62198:33"/> and contrived for the Benefit and Advantage of Men.</hi> In which his meaning is ſo untowardly expreſſed, that you cannot but think he was indiſpoſed, when he wrote ſo untowardly. He hath altered this Paſſage I hear in the <note n="(a)" place="margin">The Reader is deſired here to obſerve, That though he printed this Sermon a Second time, yet the Second Edition is not noted in the Title Page.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Edition, but ſo it is as I have reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in that which he ſent me at its firſt coming out; and indeed that very Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis in the firſt part of the Sermon <hi>(till I better informed)</hi> ſhews he was in too great haſte at leaſt when he compoſed it, elſe he would never have adventured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Opinion in a matter of ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till he had been better informed of its Truth. — I do not write this out of any Change there is in my mind concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons or Things, having the very ſame Thoughts I had when you and I converſed more frequently together, but the lamentable Caſe of Things. — I cannot but have a love to Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Perſon, though I have none for his Opinion; I therefore would gladly have him well treated, though he be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſharply reproved.</q> This with more will be produced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Hand, if there be Occaſion; and he afterwards confirmed it all to Dr. <hi>Parker</hi> when they met at <hi>London,</hi> and ſaid that he ought to give Satisfaction by a Retractation, or elſe be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. — <hi>If he will not be reduced he ought to have no mercy, but to be hunted out of the Chriſtian Church, when he will not own it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then as for the Diſſenters to whom this Paſſage was no leſs offenſive, as our Preacher ſaith, That <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 11.</note> he <hi>had a juſt Value, and due Tenderneſs for them:</hi> So he muſt give me leave to add on this Occaſion, That his Tenderneſs for them was much greater than for thoſe of the Church; for he made them Satisfaction for the Scandal this Paſſage gave them, but would never do any Thing to remove the Offence which he gave his Brethren of the Church. I came to know this Secret by an honourable Perſon of my Acquaintance, who happening to give Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> a Viſit, preſently after Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> had publiſhed his Sermon of <hi>the Miſchief of Separation,</hi> found Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at his Houſe vehemently inveighing both againſt it, and him. This gave occaſion to that Gentleman to ask him, why he was ſo ſevere upon that Sermon, and the Author of it; and yet took no notice of another which was newly come out, and which he thought had given the Men of his Party as muh offence
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62198:34"/> as it did to thoſe of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> What Sermon is that? ſaid Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> It is the Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Court Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ſaith he; wherein he tells you, That you <hi>muſt not affront the Eſtabliſhed Religion, nor openly draw Men off from the Profeſſion of it.</hi> Oh! replied Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> he gave us great Offence indeed, but he hath cried <hi>Peccavi;</hi> and made us Satisfaction; but your other Dean is a proud haughty Man, that will retract nothing. The Gentleman having finiſhed his Viſit, took leave of the Doctor, and Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> and the ſame day called upon the Dean of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, to give him an Account of what had paſſed betwixt him and Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and finding the Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi> with him; told the Story to them both. Upon which the Dean of <hi>Paul</hi>'s asked the Dean of <hi>Canterbury, And did you in good earneſt cry</hi> Peccavi <hi>to Mr.</hi> Baxter? <hi>Piſh,</hi> replied he, <hi>will you mind what Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>ſaith?</hi> But the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> not being ſatisfied with that evaſive Anſwer preſſed him to a categorical Anſwer; upon which, his Countenance alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he went away in diſorder without any Reply. I tell this Story on purpoſe to ſhew our Reverend Clergy of the Convocation what great Reaſon they have to Cenſure this Paſſage; becauſe he would never make the Church Satisfaction for it, nor do any Thing that looked like Satisfaction; but on the contrary hath lately Reprinted it in the Third Volume of his Sermons. And I hope Dr. <hi>Patrick;</hi> who was formerly ſo juſtly offended at it, will; now he hath taken an higher Character upon him, promote and propoſe the Cenſure of it in Convocation. The duty the Clergy owe the Church, and the honour of their own Order, requires them to Cenſure it; eſpecially ſince it is ſo contrary to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their Ordination, and their Duty preſcribed in it, both as Prieſts and Biſhops. There they are told, That they are Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Stewards, and Watch men of the Lord; that they are not to leave the Sheep when the Wolf cometh; and that they are to be ready, with all faithful Diligence, to drive away and baniſh all ſtrange Doctrines contrary to God's Word, as need and occaſion ſhall require. More eſpecially in the Conſecration of Biſhops, St. <hi>Paul</hi> is propoſed as an Example to them, who are indeed the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, in the Epiſtle to be read on that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. There he ſaith, <hi>That he counted not his Life dear unto him, ſo that he might finiſh his Miniſtry;</hi> but this Man's Doctrine, who was his own Patern of Preaching, teacheth the Shepherds to fly when the Wolf cometh, and to ſtop the Courſe of their Miniſtry, when the Exerciſe of it without a Miracle will coſt them their Lives. It is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62198:34"/> only in <hi>the Caſe of a Divine Commiſſion, and Miracles to prove it, that according to him a Prieſt or Biſhop is to abide all Hazards, or to expect extraordinary Aſſiſtance, and ſupernatural Supports in their Sufferings;</hi> contrary to the common Doctrine of Chriſtianity, and that in particular of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which teacheth us that God in ſuffering Times will give his faithful People ſuffering Spirits: And likewiſe to the Hiſtories of all Perſecutions ſince Miracles ceaſed; and more eſpecially to our own Martyrology in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign.</p>
            <p>His Encomiaſt <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 13.</note> tells us, That <hi>he was little diſpoſed to follow the Paterns of Preaching which former Times ſet, but that he ſet a Patern to himſelf.</hi> And from theſe Inſtances I have brought, we may ſee the Truth of what he ſaith: For the <hi>Hookers,</hi> the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſons,</hi> and <hi>Hamonds,</hi> and <hi>Pearſons,</hi> before him, never ſet ſuch Paterns of Preaching, as he ſet himſelf; but ſuch a one it is, That I hope it will neither be long, nor much followed, though his Funeral Orator hopes it will.</p>
            <p>I have exemplified above how contrary the Practice of this <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed Heroe</hi> hath been to his Principles and Doctrine, and more particularly to his genuin and orthodox Notion of the Nature of Religion; and I now proceed to ſhew that he hath not followed the generous and laudable Example of another Perſon, in the very Caſe in which he hath propoſed it for Imitation. <q>It cannot be denied, nor am I much concerned to diſſemble it (ſaith he in his Funeral Sermon on Dr. <hi>Whitchcot</hi>) that here he poſſeſſed another Man's Place, who by the Iniquity of the Times was wrongfully ejected: I mean Dr. <hi>Collins,</hi> the famous and learned Divinity Profeſſor of that Univerſity; during whoſe Life (and he lived many Years after) by the free Conſent of the College, there were two Shares out of the common Dividend allotted to the Provoſt one whereof was conſtantly paid to Dr. <hi>Collins,</hi> as if he had been ſtill Provoſt. To this Dr. <hi>Whitchcot</hi> did not only give his Conſent (without which the Thing could not have been done) but was very forward in the doing of it; though hereby he did not only conſiderably leſſen his own Profit, but likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur no ſmall Cenſure and Hazard, as Times then were. And leſt this had not been Kindneſs enough to that worthy Perſon, whoſe Place he poſſeſſed, in his laſt Will he left to his Son, Sir <hi>John Collins</hi> a Legacy of an hundred Pounds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One would think that ſuch an <hi>heroick Vertue</hi> ſhould have followed ſuch a generous Example of his own propoſing; but as Dr. <hi>Whitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:62198:35"/> had Dr. <hi>Collins</hi>'s Place, ſo he had Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi>'s Fellowſhip at the ſame Time, and never allowed him one Farthing; though he was as wrongfully ejected as Dr. <hi>Collins,</hi> and ſtood in more need of an Allowance than the Doctor did. But there is one Thing more to be ſaid for the Honour of Dr. <hi>Witchcot</hi> which he took no notice of, and it is this, That he had Dr. <hi>Collins</hi>'s Conſent to take his Place, which he himſelf had not from Dr <hi>Gunning</hi> to take his; and yet he was very angry at him for reſuming his Fellowſhip from him at the Reſtauration. This would paſs for a Blemiſh in any other Man's Life, but Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s; or if it would not, methinks his taking the Archbiſhop's Place, not only without but againſt his Conſent, ſhould paſs for a Blemiſh in his Life: He having not only got him <hi>extruded</hi> by Force out of it, but thereby made himſelf the Author and Architect of a moſt ſcandalous and outragious Schiſm; which will not only be an everlaſting Blot upon his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but if not healed an everlaſting Blemiſh upon the Church. Methinks he might have ſo far followed Dr. <hi>Whitchcot</hi>'s Example, and to have made him an offer of ſome Allowance, though he had refuſed it, as I am ſure he would have done: But far from doing that, he behaved himſelf towards him with the greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity; as appeared from expreſſing his Joy unawares to Dr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veridge</hi> for the glorious Device of the <hi>Writ of Intruſion,</hi> thinking the Doctor had come to talk with him as one that had excepted the Biſhoprick of <hi>Wells;</hi> but when he found that he came to excuſe himſelf from the Acceptance of it, he turned Pale upon reflecting he had diſcovered too much. He alſo ſuffered his Grace's Steward and Nephew, Mr. <hi>Sancroft,</hi> who kept Poſſeſſion at <hi>Lambeth</hi> for his Uncle, to be Impriſoned and Fined, though he might have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both if he would; and yet leſt him not a Legacy for repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his great Fine, as Dr. <hi>Whitchcot</hi> did to Sir <hi>John Collins,</hi> though he had all the Fruits and Profits of the Archbiſhoprick, from the time of the Deprivation to the time that he took Poſſeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And it is further obſervable, That as he enjoyed the Place of of one, who was deprived by thoſe who had uſurped the Authority of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and that of another, but of vaſter Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, who was deprived by the Power of thoſe who had firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived K. <hi>James</hi> the Second; ſo he took the Place of a third, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in <hi>Suffolk;</hi> who was Legally ejected by the <hi>Bartholomew Act,</hi> upon the Return of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: Which ſhews, That he was a Man of all Times, and all Governments, Right or Wrong; and which in truth makes him look more like <hi>a Vicar of Bray,</hi> than an
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62198:35"/> Heroe in Vertue, and will in moſt Mens Opinion take him down from that tall Character into an ordinary Man. But to return again to Dr. <hi>Whitchcot</hi>'s Funeral Sermon; there is another Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in it, which all the Men I ever ſpoke with, that heard or read it, took for a Reflection upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the following Words: <hi>He diſclaimed Popery, and, as Things of near affinity with it, Superſtition and Uſurpation upon the Conſciences of Men.</hi> I know one Clergy-man who had a fair Reſpect for him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that from this time would never defend his Reputation: And the moſt learned Mr. <hi>Dodwel,</hi> who indeed is a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of heroick Piety and Vertue, was much offended with this Paſſage, and went on purpoſe to him to let him know what juſt Offence he had given by it; but notwithſtanding he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it again in his Third Volume of Sermons, with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection in the <hi>Italick</hi> Character; which further proves what I ſaid before, That how tender ſoever he was to the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and extenſive in his Charity to them, he had not ſuch ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for true Church-men, nor ſuch a Loathneſs to offend theſe as thoſe.</p>
            <p>I now come to the Character of Orthodoxy which our Preacher gives of him, in telling us of the <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 2.</note> convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which he ſo clearly proved the Truth and Excellency of our holy Faith; and in the <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 7.</note> Character of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom he makes his Exemplar, he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates his great Concern for the Truth and Honour of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and more particularly that he aſſerted the great <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 31.</note> Myſtery of the Trinity, when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by ſome, and provoked by others to do it, with that Strength and Clearneſs which was peculiar to him. As to the firſt, I thought the Torments of Hell, as well as the Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, had been part of our holy Faith; and taught as plainly by Chriſt, the great Doctor of his Church; and alſo as much implied in the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, and the laſt Judgment: But how convincingly he hath proved the Truth of them appears from what I have ſaid above. And as to his great Concern for the Truth and Honour for the Chriſtian Religion, that appears in the ſame manner, by his Apoſtacy in his Practice from that true and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Character he gave of it in his Fifth of <hi>November</hi> Sermon; and as for the Strength and Clearneſs with which he hath proved the Myſtery of the Trinity, I refer the Reader to the Book, in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62198:36"/> the <note n="*" place="margin">Entitled, The Charge of Socinianiſm againſt Dr. Tillotſon conſider'd, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of ſome Sermons he hath lately publiſhed to clear himſelf from that Imputation, by way of Dialogue. To which are added ſome Reflections upon the Second of Dr. Burnet's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes delivered to the Clergy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, concerning the Divinity and Death of Chriſt, with a Supplement.</note> Margent, which I hope will ſee the Light before theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of mine. There he will find that his Vindication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is but a ſhuffling Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath much of <hi>Arian</hi> Cunning and Reſerve in it: And that he never departed from his <hi>Moderation</hi> in this point, as our Author ſaith he did not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>To this I ſhall add in the next place what he hath ſaid of the <hi>heinouſneſs of the Sin of Perjury,</hi> in his Aſſize Sermon upon <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. But I ſhall not inſiſt upon the Application of it, as of ſome former Paſſages, becauſe it will apply it ſelf; nor make ſome ſevere and dangerous Reflections <hi>upon his heroical Piety,</hi> becauſe they are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, that the Reader may make them himſelf. <q>There, <hi>he ſaith,</hi> that all departure from the Simplicity of an Oath is Perjury, and that a Man is never a whit the leſs forſworn, becauſe his Perjury <hi>is a little finer,</hi> and <hi>more artificial</hi> than ordinary. That he is guilty of Perjury, who having a real Intention when he ſwears to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he promiſeth, yet afterwards neglects to do it; not for want of Power, but for want of Will, and due Regard to his Oath. That the primary and ſole Intention of the Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, is to forbid the great Sin of Perjury; and that it is obſervable; That there is no Threatning added to any other Commandment; but to this and the Second; which intimates to us, that next to Idolatry, and the Worſhip of a falſe God, Perjury is one of the greateſt Affronts that can be offered to the Divine Majeſty. — This is one of thoſe Sins that cries aloud to Heaven, and quickens the pace of God's Judgments.— This Sin, by the Secret Judgment of God, undermines Eſtates and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to the utter ruin of them; and among the Heathens it was always reckoned one of the greateſt Crimes, and which they did believe God did not only puniſh upon the guilty Perſon himſelf, but many times upon whole Nations, as the Prophet alſo tells us, That <hi>becauſe of Oaths the Land mourns.</hi> I need not uſe many Words to aggravate this Sin; It is certainly a Crime of the higheſt Nature, deliberate Perjury being directly againſt a Man's knowledge; ſo that no Man can commit it without ſtaring his Conſcience in the Face, which is one of the greateſt Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62198:36"/> of any Crime; and it is equally a Sin againſt both Tables, being the higheſt Affront to God, and of moſt injurious Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to Men. — In reſpect of Men, it is not only a Wrong to this or that particular Perſon, who ſuffers by it; but <hi>Treaſon to human Society,</hi> ſubverting at once the Foundations of publick. Peace and Juſtice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is juſt what our ſuffering Clergy and People ſay of Perjury, and in conſequence of it for their own Vindication. Indeed they ſuffer like Men of <hi>heroick Piety,</hi> becauſe they could not outſtare their Conſciences, as ſome other Men did; and in their Opinion, which they have ſo nobly defended, commit Treaſon againſt Mankind, and the King. Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> told the Biſhop of <hi>Killmore, He would be ſacrificed before he took the new Oath of Allegiance:</hi> And Dr. <hi>Dove</hi> ſaid, <hi>He would give a Thouſand Pound that he might not take it;</hi> ſuch Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings they had to overcome the Dictates of their own Conſciences, which preached unto them the heinous Nature of Perjury: And if thoſe, who took that Oath with ſo much Difficulty, would but remember their own Caſe, they would have more Compaſſion for thoſe who could not take it at all; more eſpecially had that Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which our Preacher ſaith his Heroe of Piety had for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters been genuin, and the undeſign'd Effect of his tender and extenſive Charity, he would have been as tender and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Diſſenters in this Reign, as to thoſe of the two former. It was fear of Perjury, the moſt heinous Sin of Perjury, againſt which he preached ſo well, that made them ſtand out; and if they are under a Miſtake, he ought to have pitied and ſympathiz'd with them more than other Men. Nay, upon reading this excellent Paſſage againſt Perjury, one would think he ſhould have had more Tenderneſs and Pity for them than for the diſſenting Parties; but inſtead of that, he was an early and vigorous Perſecutor of them, and ſo continued to his laſt Stroke; though they had defended their Cauſe much better than the Diſſenters were, or ever will be, able to defend theirs. The Sunday after the Firſt of <hi>February,</hi> the day of Deprivation, ſome of the Non-ſwearing Clergy preached in their Churches, as I remember Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> was one; and on Munday Morning following one of my Acquaintance going to this Man about ſome Buſineſs, he inveighed ſeverely againſt their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and ſaid, <hi>Government was not to be ſo affronted.</hi> At St. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> where he lies buried, he preached often againſt them; twice more eſpecially, at the beginning of Two ſeveral Seſſions of Parliament, and by degrees forgetting what he had preached againſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62198:37"/> the heinous Sin of Perjury. He thought Priſons, and all the hard Uſages of them, which in former Reigns he was wont to call un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and inhuman Methods of converting Men, not too bad for the beſt of them. When others ſometimes would pity them for being deprived, and alſo dragoon'd by the new way of double Taxing, he would ſay, They brought their Sufferings upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and which was yet more inhuman, he endeavoured to rob them of the <hi>Glory</hi> of their ſuffering for Conſcience, and to bring yet more Sufferings upon them: As if indeed they had been what Mr. <hi>Dolben</hi> called them at the Seſſions in <hi>Northampton, The Vermin of the Nation which ought to be deſtroyed.</hi> Yet our Preacher ſaith, That <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 26. 27.</note> he had a Sweetneſs and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs in his Nature that lean'd to Exceſs, and that he he never did an ill Office, or hard Thing, to any Perſon; whereas in his Thankſgiving Sermon at <hi>Whitehall</hi> for the Victory at Sea, he repreſents his old ſuffering Brethren only as <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders</hi> to Conſcience, and in his ſly way inſinuates, that the moſt likely and effectual way to reduce them, was to load them yet with more Sufferings. Saith he, <hi>As bad an Argument as Succeſs is of a good Cauſe, I am ſorry to ſay it, but am afraid it is true; it is like in the Concluſion to prove the beſt Argument of all others to convince thoſe; who have ſo long pretended Conſcience againſt ſubmiſſion to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government.</hi> One ſuch Intimation at Court againſt the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and ſuch a Character of them, in the former Reigns, would have been ſaid to have proceeded from an unchriſtian Spirit of Perſecution; but for fear one Inſinuation ſhould not have been enough againſt our preſent Sufferers, in the next Paragraph he ſaith it over again in other Words to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>Meer Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is certainly one of the worſt Arguments in the World of a good Cauſe, and the moſt improper to ſatisfy Conſcience; and yet we find by Experience that in the Iſſue it is the moſt ſucceſsful of all other Arguments, and doth in a very odd, but effectual way, ſatisfy the Conſciences of a great many Men, by ſhewing them their Intereſts;</hi> which is the true Purport, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and Engliſh of that Latin Sentence of his dear Friend the Maſter of the Charter houſe, whom he made Clerk of the Cloſet in the Dedication of his <hi>Archaeologia</hi> to K. <hi>W.

            </p>
            <p>From hence I proceed to make ſome Animadverſions upon ſome Sayings of our Preacher, concerning his Heroe, which lie ſcatter'd about his Funeral Sermon: <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 29.</note> He tells us he never <hi>affected pompous Severities,</hi> by which we know
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62198:37"/> very well he means the Auſterities of Faſting and Abſtinence, which the Church not only recommends but enjoyns, and that <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 21.</note> he complied with the ill Practice of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Pluralities</hi> in the former Reigns, becauſe it was common; and <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 27.</note> intimates alſo plain enough, That the ill Uſage he met with by thoſe Reflections which he deſcribes as Calumnies and Reproaches, help to break his Heart. But now, for God's ſake, how doth the Character of <hi>heroick Piety</hi> agree to a Man that practiſed no Auſterities, and that complied for his Advantage with the corrupt Cuſtoms of the Times? For heroick is always ſevere Piety, and full of Self-denial, and addicted to obſerve the wholeſom Rules and Doctrines of Mortification, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe that are preſcribed by the Wiſdom of the Church; and it never complies with, but reſiſts the prevailing Corruptions of the Times, like <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Chaldea, Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> or <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon.</hi> And with what Congruity did he ſet him forth for an Example of <hi>heroick Vertue,</hi> who had ſo little Chriſtian Courage, or ſupport from his own Innocency, as to ſink under the Calumnies of Men, which <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> and a Thouſand brave Heathen Heroes, would have deſpiſed? Certainly this Character of <hi>heroick Piety and Vertue</hi> agrees much better with the deprived Clergy, who are Men generally ſpeaking of more auſtere Lives; and bear not only Calumnies, and Reproaches, and cruel Mockings, but the Loſs of all they had with exemplary Patience, Courage, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to the Will of God, by which they are conformed in their Sufferings to thoſe <hi>Worthies</hi> which the Apoſtle propoſes for our Imitation in the 11th Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and deſerve now to be reverenced by all good Chriſtians as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> who dare be Honeſt and Poor; and prefer the Truth and Honour of their Religion, before the Lands and Revenues of the Church. More particularly it agrees much better with the late Archbiſhop Dr. <hi>Sancroft,</hi> upon whom our Preacher thinks he neatly couched a Reflection, when he told us that his Heroe who intruded upon him did not affect <hi>pompous Auſterities.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he practiſed them, but without Pomp, or Oſtentation. And as for his Sufferings of all Sorts, both in theſe and former Times, he bore them with exemplary Courage and Chearfulneſs: They <hi>had no influence on his Health,</hi> but quite contrary. He bleſſed God for them; and told my Lord <hi>N.</hi> when his Lordſhip went to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:62198:38"/> to try his Conſtancy, That he <hi>had rather ſuffer any Perſecution under a Lawful Prince than be preferred under an Uſurper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He tells us again, <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 28.</note> 
               <hi>That few Men obſerved hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature better than his Hero, or could make larger Allowance for the Frailty of Mankind than he did:</hi> And ſo it appears from the Character he gave his <hi>Maſter,</hi> in his Thankſgiving Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for the Victory at Sea. There he ſaith, <hi>That he was a Prince who hath made it the great Study and Endeavour of his Life to imitate the Divine Perfections, as far as the Imperfection of human Nature in this mortal State would admit.</hi> Before I make any other Reflection upon this Paſſage, I muſt here tell the World, That in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reigns no Man could leſs endure any Thing ſpoken in the Pulpit, though never ſo modeſtly and correctly in the Praiſes of our Kings. It was his common Practice to cenſure it in others on all Occaſions, and to ſay, That Flattery was ſo mean and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable a Thing in it ſelf, and ſavour'd ſo ſtrong of Intereſt and Deſign in the Pulpit, that Clergy-men ought to avoid all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it: And yet behold how ſhamefully he flatters his King here, and I doubt not <note n="(b)" place="margin">See the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon ſome late Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> but it is owing to the ill Example he ſet the Clergy in this, and ſome former Sermons, that we have had of late ſo many fulſom and deſpicable Sermons of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, as no Age ever ſaw, or will I hope ſee again. But this of his <hi>Prince's imitating the Divine Perfections,</hi> is the higheſt Strain of all; and ſhews with a Witneſs what large Allowances he made for the Frailties and Imperfections of Men.

            <p>He tells us <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 19, 20.</note> of <hi>the great Concourſe of the Clergy-men to his Lecture, which made People conſider him as the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62198:38"/> Head of that Learned Body.</hi> But the Concourſe of the Clergy to that Lecture hath continued ſince, and yet no Man looks on the ingenious Perſon that ſucceeds him, as the Head of them: And how far he was conſidered from being the Head of the Clergy, did appear in the Convocation, where, to his great Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Aſtoniſhment of our Preacher, another was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Prolocutor, who for Learning and Orthodoxy was much fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Chair than he.</p>
            <p>He tells us alſo, <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 18.</note> That he <hi>turn'd the greateſt Part of this vaſt City to an hearty Love of the Church:</hi> So that all the reſt of the <hi>London</hi> Clergy turned not half ſo many to the Love of the Church as he alone did. But I could name ſome of them who turn'd Two for his One to an hearty Love of it; and to ſuch an hearty Love of it, as they endured Perſecution for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to it: But as for his Converts to the Church they were, generally ſpeaking, but imperfect Conformiſts to the Church; ſuch as did not live in the full or ſole Communion of it, and ſuch as rather bore with it than lov'd it; becauſe he preached and perſwaded them to it as a tolerable, but not as a laudable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Conſtitution. And hence it came to paſs that ſo many of them did not love the Worſhip of it, with a Love of Delight and Complacency, which is the Love of the Heart; but were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to uſe it for want of better, as the common Proverb ſaith of nice and curious Palats, That they can make a Shift with brown Bread, till they can get white. I have known many of his conſtant Followers, and have found by Experience what I ſay to be true, and I appeal to the Clergy of <hi>London,</hi> if they have not made the ſame Obſervation; and particularly I knew one venerable Clergy-man, now with God, to whom one of his and our Preacher's Admirers too, I mean my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> made no difficulty to acknowledge, That he took not ſuch Delight in the Common Prayers, as others; and had rather have had others in his Chappel, if he might, than thoſe.</p>
            <p>He alſo tells us, That he had <hi>a ſuperiour Judgment to moſt Men:</hi> But how doth that appear from one whole Sermon, and ſome Paſſages out of others, which I have obſerved? Had he not been ſo unhappy as to ſet himſelf his own Patern, but <hi>followed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62198:39"/> ſome Paterns of former Times,</hi> particularly the Judicious <hi>Sanderſon</hi>'s, he had never preached ſo many dangerous, falſe, and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Things; nor given Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> when he preached againſt his Sermon of Hell Torments at St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s occaſion to ſay, That he had no cauſe to think himſelf a greater Maſter of Reaſon than other Men, or that he had more of it than they. And that he was not always attended with this ſuperiour Judgment even in his moſt deliberate Compoſures, appears from a Paſſage in his <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 103.</note> Third Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Education, where he ſaith, <hi>That the Duty of nurſing Children, being a natural Duty of Women, is of more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and indiſpenſible Obligation, than any poſitive Precept of Religion.</hi> Good God!

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62198:40"/> and that Kings may call, and tempt, and importune us to commit deadly Sins, as well as other Men.

            <p>He tell us alſo, <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 3.</note> That he would ſpeak with <hi>great Reſerves</hi> of him, and ſo he hath. For how often was he wont to declare his Reſolution, that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a Biſhop? I have often heard him admir'd upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that ſelf-denying Reſolution, and alſo obſerved how ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable his Refuſal of ſome Biſhopricks would render his Name to Poſterity. But when Men make ſuch Reſolutions, they make them it ſeems with a tacit Reſerve to the perſiſting Call of a King. For I can name two Perſons, now in the Places of deprived Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and one of them to my certain knowledg, who vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared againſt taking of the Places of any of the deprived Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: But I ſuppoſe <hi>their Majeſties</hi> made choice of <hi>them</hi> too, as the fitteſt Perſons, and that they looked upon their perſiſting in their Intentions as the Call and Voice of God, diſpenſing not only with their former moſt deliberate Reſolutions, but alſo with all the Fundamental Laws of Eccleſiaſtical Unity to the contrary, the Examples of the beſt and pureſt Ages, and the Canons of the Church.</p>
            <p>He alſo tells us, <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 10, 11.</note> That his firſt Education was among the <hi>Puritans,</hi> but of the beſt Sort; and that he was ſoon free'd from his firſt Impreſſions and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, or rather that he was never maſtered with them: But I have reaſon to think that they were not the beſt ſort of <hi>Puritans,</hi> under whom he had his firſt Education. Firſt, Becauſe his Father very early turned Anabaptiſt, which gave ſome Occaſion to call his Baptiſm into queſtion: And Secondly, Becauſe the beſt ſort of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> as hath been often ſhewed, were far from the Principles of Reſiſtance and Rebellion; but under whomſoever he had his firſt Education, he came ſeaſoned to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> with thoſe Principles. For not long after he came thither, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was brought by <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at Sir <hi>John Cuts</hi> his Houſe at <hi>Childerly</hi> near that Univerſity, the Scholars went thither to kiſs his Hand: But he, and ſome few more, had ſo ſignaliz'd themſelves for thoſe they then called
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62198:40"/> 
               <hi>Round-heads,</hi> that they were not admitted to that Honour with the reſt of the Scholars. Within a Year or two after he went out <hi>Midſummer-Batchelor of Arts;</hi> by which, having locally qualified himſelf for a Fellowſhip, he got the <hi>Rump's Mandamus</hi> for Dr. <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>'s, (which I think one of his own Gang enjoyed a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him) as a Reward for his good affection to the <hi>Cauſe.</hi> From that time to his diſcontinuance he governed the College; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Fellows not daring to oppoſe him, becauſe of the Intereſt he had with his great Maſters: And ſo zealous was he for them, That the Corner of the College, which he and his Pupils took up in the new Building, was called the <hi>Round-head</hi> Corner. And when King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was beaten at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> he ſent for the Tables in which the <hi>College Grace</hi> was written, and after the Paſſage of Thankſgiving for their Benefactors, <hi>Te Laudamus pro Benefactoribus noſtris,</hi> &amp;c. he added with his own Hand, and of his own Head, <hi>Praeſertim pro nupera Victoria contra</hi> Carolum Stuartum <hi>in Agro</hi> Wigornienſi <hi>reportata,</hi> or to that effect. In the Year 1656. or the Beginning of 1657. he diſcontinued from the College, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invited by <hi>Prideaux, Cromwel</hi>'s Attorney General, to teach his Son, and do the Office of a Chaplain in his Family; and the Reader may pleaſe to take notice, That his Son was the ſame Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> who was in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion. I have related all this upon very good Authority, to ſhew that Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> had not his firſt Education under the beſt <hi>Puritans,</hi> and that he was not ſo ſoon free'd from the Prejudices and Impreſſions of it; but that hitherto he was perfectly maſter'd by them: And whether or no they had not ſome influence over him all his Life long, I leave the Reader, from what I have ſaid of him in this Chapter, to judge.</p>
            <p>He tell us again, <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 11.</note> That though ha was ſoon free'd from the firſt Prejudices of his Puritanical Education, yet he ſtuck to <hi>the Strictneſs of Life</hi> to which he was bred under them.

                  <hi>P.</hi> 20.</note> That his <hi>extraordinary Worth forced ſome, who had no Kindneſs for him, to advance him: THE SOME</hi> he means is only King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, who plainly perceived that he was not quite <hi>free'd from the Prejudices of his firſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62198:41"/> Education;</hi> for when he officiated in the Cloſet, inſtead of Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or rather to <hi>Jeſus</hi> at the mentioning of his ſaving Name, that he might ſeem to do ſomething, and yet not do the thing it ſelf, he uſed to ſtep and bend backwards, caſting up his Eyes to Heaven; which the King obſerving, ſaid, He Bowed the wrong way, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do when they ſalute their Friends. And yet though his Majeſty, who was a great Diſcerner of Men, perfectly knew him, he preferred him to gratify the Heads of a Party. And may all Princes, who for <hi>Politick Ends</hi> prefer thoſe for whom they have no Kindneſs, and who have not true Kindneſs for them, be requited as he was.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 13.</note> 
               <hi>That he ſtudied all the Ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and Books of Morality.</hi> But bate me an Ace of that, quoth <hi>Bolton;</hi> for I will be bold to ſay, He was ſo far from Reading them all, that he ſcarce Saw them all, or had the curioſity to read them, eſpecially thoſe in the <hi>Greek</hi> Language. Then he tells us, That <hi>among the Fathers, St.</hi> Baſil, <hi>and St.</hi> Chryſoſtom, <hi>were thoſe he chiefly read.</hi> But how came he, who had ſuch <hi>a ſuperior Judgment,</hi> to read ſo many Philoſophers, and ſo few Fathers, and to take up with Two of Five more which our Preacher ſaith <note n="(b)" place="margin">See his Pref. before Bedel's Life.</note> were the Beauties of the Silver Age of the Church? Methinks one that deſired to be a conſummat Divine ſhould have been as willing to read the great <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the <hi>Gregorys,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin;</hi> but more eſpecially one that deſired to be an Orthodox Divine ſhould methinks have well ſtudied the <hi>Clements,</hi> the <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s, the <hi>Polycarps,</hi> the <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>'s, the <hi>Tertullians,</hi> and the <hi>Cyprians,</hi> who <note n="(c)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> he ſaith, <hi>were the Glories of the Golden Age of the Church.</hi> He had better by much have ſtudied all them, than all the Ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers; and had <hi>he went into all the beſt Things of thoſe Fathers,</hi> as it ſeems <hi>he did into all the beſt Things of Biſhop</hi> Wilkins, I need not fear to ſay, he had been a much ſurer Guide, as well as a more learned and profound Divine; and had not been ſo ready at all times to treat away thoſe Things with Diſſenters, which give ſuch an Advantage to the Church of <hi>England</hi> above all the Reformed, and more particularly enable her to anſwer that unhappy Queſtion of our common Adverſaries, <hi>Where is your Miſſion?</hi> The not being able to anſwer which, as we can do, hath contributed more to the Ruin of the <hi>French</hi> Reformed Church, than all the late Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62198:41"/> For he would have learned in thoſe Fathers, who lived neareſt to the Times of the Apoſtles, that Biſhops were their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and next under Chriſt the Heads of their particular Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes: From whom the Presbyters derived their Powers, and to whom they, and the People, were to be ſubject for Chriſt's ſake. Had he thoroughly learned and imbibed this Doctrine, which is beſt learned from thoſe Fathers, he would in all likelihood have been as loth to part from it, as thoſe the Latitudinarian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors are apt to call <hi>narrow and angry Men;</hi> becauſe they are not for Treaties of Comprehenſion with Diſſenters upon ſuch Terms, as are not conſiſtent with the Catholick and Apoſtolick Tradition concerning Epiſcopacy, and Epiſcopal Ordinations; and which, if yielded to, would be of more dangerous Conſequence to the Religion we profeſs, than all our Diſſenters are, or can be.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, our Preacher cannot but tell us <note n="(a)" place="margin">

For I make no difficulty to confeſs to the Reverend Doctor, That I am one of thoſe many Thouſands who ſuſpect his admirable Primates <hi>pious Deſigns of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Church</hi> his own way: For he was always for blending of Orders under Pretence of Union, and ſince he commenced <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Primate,</hi> he was wont to adviſe the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Epiſcopal Clergy-men to ſubmit to <hi>their</hi> Presbyterians, and do all Acts of Compliance to their pretended Authority; which was in effect to adviſe them not only to commit the higheſt Act of Diſobedience and Schiſm againſt their own Biſhops, but to abjure Epiſcopacy with thoſe who deteſt and abjure it as an Antichriſtian Uſurpation over the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62198:42"/> Church of God. The good Lord of his Mercy deliver his Church from ſuch admirable Primates and Biſhops, as are Traytors to their own Order; and from ſuch <hi>tender Methods of Union, and pious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of ſerving the Church,</hi> as they may without breach of Charity be ſuppoſed to have. Our Preacher, as well as his Heroe, may be numbred among thoſe <hi>pious Deſigners</hi> for going to wait upon the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> when he was laſt in <hi>London,</hi> ſome days before he went for <hi>Scotland:</hi> He took upon him to tell his Grace, That he would ruin his Intereſt, if he did not ſtick faſt to the Presbyterian Cauſe; for they began to fear that he was not for it to them. And thereupon he adviſed him, as he regarded his own Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and <hi>the Kings Favour,</hi> to be ſure to promote the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Intereſt. This the Duke told to a Perſon of Honour before he left the Town. And now hear, O ye <note n="*" place="margin">See the Pref. before Bedel's Life.</note> 
               <hi>Clements, Ignatius</hi>'s, <hi>Polycarps, Deny</hi>'s, <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s, and <hi>Cyprians,</hi> of the Golden Age of the Church, was not this Apoſtolical Councel in a Man that bears your holy Character? Could he do any Thing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, than to adviſe a Prince of his Country to ſupport thoſe, and ſtick to theſe, who have declared your Holy Order to be Antichriſtian, and aboliſhed it as an Uſurpation, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your Succeſſors, as much as in them lies, for Uſurpers over the Church of God. Nay, let all Men that read this Story con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it a little in its juſt Conſequences, and Reflections upon this wretched Man, as he is a Biſhop, and a Biſhop who formerly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the Office of a Biſhop to be an Apoſtolical Inſtitution. Read what he hath wrote for it in his Preface to Biſhop <hi>Bedel</hi>'s Life. <hi>It is not poſſible to think that a Government can be Criminal, under which the World received the Chriſtian Religion and that in a Courſe of many Ages; in which, as all the Corners of the Chriſtian Church, ſo all the Parts of it the Sound as well as the Unſound, that is, the Orthodox, as well as the Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, agreed. The Perſecutions that then lay ſo heavy upon the Church, made it no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable Thing for a Man to be expoſed to their firſt Fury, which was always the Biſhops Portion: And that in a Courſe of many Centuries; in which there was nothing but Poverty and Labour to be got by the Employment. There being no Princes to ſet it on, as an Engin of Government; and no Synods of Clergy men gathered to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that Authority to themſelves, by joynt Deſigns and Endeavours.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62198:42"/> And can it be imagined that in all that glorious Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, — there ſhould not ſo much as one ſingle Perſon be found, on whom either a Love of Truth, or an Envy of the Advancement of others, prevailed ſo far as to declare againſt ſuch an early and univerſal Corruption, if it is to be eſteemed one? When all this is complicated together, it is really of ſo great Authority, that I love not to give the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Name to that Temper that can withſtand ſo plain a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. For what can a Man even herited with all the Force of Imagination, and poſſeſſed with all the Sharpneſs of Prejudice, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to the Inference made from theſe Premiſſes, That a Form ſo ſoon introduced; and ſo wonderfully bleſt, could not be contrary to the Rules of the Goſpel, and cannot be aſcribed to any other Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but that the Apoſtles every where eſtabliſhed it as a Fence about the Goſpel which they planted; ſo that our Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are to be reckoned Twins, born at the ſame Time, and both derived from the ſame Fathers? —Therefore it will perhaps be neceſſary, in order to the giving a fuller and amiabler Proſpect of that Apoſtolical Conſtitution,</hi> &amp;c. And if it is an Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conſtitution, with what Face or Conſcience could he ſolicit the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> to adhere to thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to be a Diabolical and Antichriſtian Uſurpation? But if it is not, and by conſequence not an Inſtitution of unalterable Right, Why do we continue it? Why is the Church troubled with two Orders of Prieſthood when one would ſerve? It hath coſt this Nation much Blood and Treaſure to ſupport it. The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> might have had his Life, if he would have bought it at ſo dear a Hate, as to perſwade King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt to conſent to the Aboliſhing of it: That bleſſed Prince died a Martyr for it: And our Primate of everlaſting Memory, Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> was ſacrificed for it. And yet, alas! it is now abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in one Kingdom, and diſgraced and polluted with Schiſm in the other two: And the very Foundation of it hath been and is ſtill an undermining under the popular Pretences of <hi>tender Methods</hi> and <hi>pious Deſigns.</hi> Let the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the <hi>Lord's Day, Infant Baptiſm,</hi> the <hi>Two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> the Doctine of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> which ſtand upon the ſame bottom, be all treated away with it. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62198:43"/> with thoſe, as well as with this, will make the Union yet more Glorious and Comprehenſive, and more worthy of the pious Undertakers. For I know no Reaſon why the <hi>Anabaptiſts, Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> ſhould not alſo be taken in: But as to my own particular, I muſt here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That I am for pure Catholick and unmixt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and if after this deſigned Comprehenſion of the Sects, there is to be found but One ſuch Church of Two or Three, in what corner of the Land ſoever, I will join my ſelf to that.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 7.</note> he ſaith <hi>had</hi> large Thoughts <hi>concerning the Idol Feaſts,</hi> and <hi>Meats offered to Idols.</hi> As this is a crude and indecent way of Speaking of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſo it is groundleſs and falſe; he having ſtated the Caſe of Idol Feaſts, and of Eating of Meats, and Drinking of Drinks, that have been offered up in Sacrifice to Idols, with all the <hi>Strictneſs</hi> that the Nature of them required. For firſt, as to the Idol Feaſts, or of Eating and Drinking at the Feaſts in the Heathen Temples, which were joyned to the Sacrifices offered unto Idols, he determines it to be unlawful in a two fold Reſpect. Firſt, with reſpect to the Subſtance of the Action, as it as it was <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>Demonolatry,</hi> or worſhipping of Devils, and holding Communion with them;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62198:43"/> which therefore provoked the Lord to Jealouſie, when thoſe who drank his Cup, would drink the Cup of Devils; and partakers of his Table, would alſo partake of the Tables of Devils. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he determines it to be unlawful with reſpect to the circumſtance, or conſequence of the action, becauſe thoſe pretenders to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge among the Chriſtians, who frequented Idol-Feaſts, did not only confirm the Gentiles in their Idolatry, and harden the Jews in their unblief, but <note n="‖" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor. VIII. v.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> alſo by their contagious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples drew the weaker Chriſtians to pollute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Demonolatry, or Communion with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and ſo were anſwerable to God, for cauſing their Brethren to periſh, for whom Chriſt died. And now let any ſerious man conſider this determination of the Apoſtle againſt Chriſtians going to Idol Temples to eat at Idol Feaſts, either with reſpect to the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> or <hi>Circumſtance</hi> of the thing, and then let him tell me if it is not as ſtrict, and free from <hi>latitude,</hi> or <hi>largeneſs of thought,</hi> as the Doctrine of worſhiping the one true God, and having no other Gods but him.</p>
            <p>The like ſtrictneſs we ſhall alſo find in determining the caſe of Chriſtians eating of meats, which had been offered unto Idolls at their own, or at their unbelieving Friends Houſes: For it ſeems part of the Sacrifices which had been offered unto Idolls were often ſold to the <hi>Butchers</hi> by the <hi>Idol-Prieſts;</hi> from which aroſe two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions among the Chriſtians of theſe times, one whereof was, whether they ought to eat what was bought in the Shambles at their own Houſes? Becauſe what they eat might perhaps have been ſuch portions of the Sacrifices as the Idol Prieſts had ſold to the Butchers; and the other was whether they ought to eat at their unconverted Friends, or Relations Houſes of every thing that was ſet before them without asking if it had been any part of thoſe Sacrifices which had been offered unto Idolls? The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reaſon of this later queſtion was, as I conceive, becauſe the Gentiles eſteemed thoſe portions of Idol Sacrifices, as more holy, than common fleſh, and would be ſure to buy them for their Feaſts and Entertainment if they could get them. To theſe two queſtions the Apoſtle anſwers in general, that it was lawful for them to enjoy any of God's Creatures, none of them being in their own nature impure, and that therefore they might ſafely eat what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was ſold in the Market without thinking themſelves bound in conſcience to enquire whether any thing they met with in the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62198:44"/> Shambles, or were to eat at their own, or their Friends Houſes, were portions of Idol Sacrifices, or no? But then if any man told them, that ſuch, and ſuch meats had been offered unto Idols, then they were neither to buy them in the Market, nor eat of them at their own, or at their Friends Houſes for fear of giving <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor. X v.</hi> 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32.</note> offence to others, whether <hi>Believers</hi> or <hi>Unbelievers.</hi> Firſt to <hi>Believers</hi> eſpecially of the weaker ſort, who ſeeing them buy, or eat, what they had been told was offer'd unto Idols might from the former relation thoſe portions had unto the Idol, think they worſhipped the Idol, and ſo be encourag'd to eat againſt their Conſciences, and perhaps proceed further to eat at the <hi>Idol Feaſts,</hi> which was downright Idolatry. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> Jews or Gentiles; the former whereof coming to know that Chriſtians bought, or eat what had been offered unto Idols, would be ſcandalized thereby againſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; and the later in like manner ſeeing them do ſo, would be encourag'd to perſiſt in their Demonolatry, becauſe they might preſume that the Chriſtians buying, or eating wittingly, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly what had been offered up in Sacrifice to their Gods, did ſo out of reſpect to them, as they themſelves did. I think this was very ſtrict Divinity to forbid Chriſtians the uſe, and enjoyment of thoſe things, which otherwiſe they were free to uſe, and enjoy both at home, and abroad, purely upon the account of other mens Conſciences, becauſe they were to give no offence neither to the unbelieving Jew, nor to the Idolatrous Gentiles, nor to the weaker Members of the Church of God. Had our Preacher lived in thoſe days, I am afraid he would have cenſured the Apoſtle, as a man of <hi>narrow thoughts,</hi> who was too much influenced by Jewiſh notions, and ſuperſtition in theſe ſevere determinations, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was to make a Parallel between the Apoſtle, and his <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> Hero, therefore right, or wrong he was to take ſome occaſion to let us know, that the Apoſtle had his <hi>large thoughts</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Another of his Phraſes, which he choſe rather to uſe improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than to omit, is that of the <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>juſt freedoms of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> where he tells us, that his Heroick Primate aſſerted the great Truths of Religion, when he ſaw them ſtruck at, with an authority, and zeal proportioned to the importance of them, while in leſſer matters he left men to the juſt freedoms of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature — but he ſhould have ſaid, had he ſpoke properly,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62198:44"/> to their <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> for the <hi>freedoms of Human Nature</hi> relate to men, as they are conſidered in a civil, or in their <hi>natural ſtate,</hi> if there ever had been, or were any ſuch. But this being one of the golden Phraſes of the <hi>Latitudinarians,</hi> he was reſolved to tip his Tongue, and gild one Period with it, for that ſort of men, have their <hi>Jargon,</hi> and <hi>Cant,</hi> as well as others, and particularly affect to talk of the <hi>Rights, Liberties, or Freedoms of Mankind,</hi> or of <hi>the Rights, Liberties, or Freedoms of Human Nature,</hi> altho' every man in the World only hath ſuch Rights, and ſuch Liberties as the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Country, where he is born, or whither he betake himſelf give him, and no more. Hence the <note n="*" place="margin">Inſt. Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de jure perſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>narum.</note> Roman Law defineth <hi>Liberty</hi> to be a <hi>Natural Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or Faculty, which every man hath to do what he pleaſeth, as far, as he is not hindered by law or force.</hi> This definition ſhews, that mens natural liberty is reſtrained more or leſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the civil conſtitutions of different Countrys, and this is ſo true, that in ſome places, the greateſt part of Mankind have almoſt no Liberties; and Slaves which were the greateſt part of Mankind in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as now in ſome of our Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had none at all. Yet notwithſtanding this is ſo plain, and obvious a Notion, our <hi>Latitudinarians,</hi> when it ſerves their turn (as it did in former Reigns) love to talk of the Rights, and Liberties of Mankind, or Human Nature, becauſe they are ſplendid Phraſes, which by ſeeming to have ſomething great in them, are apt to gull unthinking men, tho' they ſignifie nothing at all. Tell them of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> or the unlawfulneſs of Reſiſtance, they will tell you again, that it is a Doctrine againſt the Rights and Freedoms of Mankind. I knew a Gentleman, to whom an unfortunate Lord of our Preachers acquaintance ſaid ſo, and we may without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bold inference gueſs from whom he had the deceitful inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Phraſe, which to ſerve ill purpoſes may be uſed againſt Laws and Conſtitutions, that reſtrain mens Liberties in civil Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, in any other reſpect, as well as in not reſiſting the Supream Power, and would help to juſtifie inſurrections not only of Slaves, but of Subjects, and more eſpecially of the common People all the World over. So the Diſpenſing Power under King <hi>James</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration was againſt the juſt freedoms of Human Nature, and the French Government was, and is againſt the Rights, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of Human Nature, though ſome Governments harder than it, and the exerciſe of them is not ſo in other places, where Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62198:45"/> as Conſcientious, and at leaſt as Orthodox as thoſe of <hi>France</hi> are ruined, and undone for Conſcience ſake, and as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually Dragoon'd without Dragoons by Deprivation and double Taxes, of which I am confident our Preacher would ſay, if he ſuffered ſuch Penalties, that they were againſt the Rights of Human Nature, and the Liberties of Mankind. But for my own part, as I always ſuſpected ſuch ſpecious Phraſes, and thoſe, who uſed them: ſo I know not to what purpoſe they ſerve, but to beget falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the minds of men, and incite them to ſubvert States, and Kingdoms, and level all Orders of Men in them, and I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerved that thoſe who uſed them, ſet up for <hi>Demagogues,</hi> and were moſt forward when it was in their power to invade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens Rights, and abridge other mens Liberties, eſpecially thoſe of their lawful Kings, and their Loyal Fellow Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the Laws of Nature, the Laws of God, or the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>In the ſame place he tells us, <hi>that while</hi> the Defunct <hi>aſſerted the great Truths of Religion, he left men in leſſer matters to be governed by thoſe great meaſures of Diſcretion, and Charity, a care to avoid Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and to promote Edification, and Peace, and Decency, and Order.</hi> This in an Author ſo given to ſubtile, and malicious inſinuations, looks like one upon the generality of the Clergy, as if they did not ſo, but were more zealous for the leſſer, than the greater matters of our Religion. But not to mention the Great men among our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Clergy, did not our <hi>Hookers, Sanderſons,</hi> and <hi>Hammonds,</hi> as well as thoſe, who have followed their example, aſſert the great Truths of Religion, as zealouſly, as his Hero did, and tho' they defended both the Authority, and Wiſdom of the Church in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Ceremonies, and things in themſelves indifferent to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (which he means by leſſer matters) and alſo took care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Conſciences of the People; what a great, and weighty Duty Obedience, and Submiſſions to the Orders of the Church was, and that morally conſidered, it was none of the leſſer matters of Chriſtianity: yet in their <hi>juſt freedoms</hi> they left them to be governed, as he ſaith his Archbiſhop did, <hi>by the meaſures of Diſcretion and Charity, and a care to avoid Scandal, and to promote Edification, and Peace, and Decency, and Order.</hi> But in Truth this Character of leaving men to their <hi>Freedoms,</hi> as Chriſtians, was ſo very true of Doctor <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> that he left them to their Freedoms, where neither he nor they were free, and to govern themſelves by their own private
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62198:45"/> Conſciences and diſcretion, when they neither promoted Charity, nor Edification, nor Peace, Decency, or Order, but gave ſcandal in both Senſes, as it ſignifies grieving our fellow Chriſtians, and by our Example occaſioning others to ſin. I will inſtance in his giving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper to thoſe, who would receive it in no poſture, but that irreverent one of <hi>ſitting.</hi> This was his Practice at <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Inn Chappel, whither a great Lady of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Congregation, and one of <hi>his</hi> Hearers too, would ſometimes reſort to receive the Sacrament, becauſe, as ſhe told a Noble Lord of my acquaintance, ſhe could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it the<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e <hi>ſitting.</hi> And his Practice, as a devout Gentlewoman, who lived in that Neighbourhood, aſſured me, was firſt to walk about with the Elements to thoſe in the Pews, where the Sitters were, and give it them firſt, but in the laſt place to thoſe who kneel'd at the Rail, within which he would not go, as decency would have directed another Man, but coming behind them, he gave it them in the Letter of the Proverb, over the left Shouldier. So the late Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph</hi> at Dr. <hi>Kidder</hi>'s Church not long after the Revolution gave Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> and ſome others the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in the ſame irreverent poſture, to the great offence of ſome part of the Congregation, that ſaw it; and for ought he knew, to the endangering of others to deſpiſe the Orders of the Church. I could give other inſtances of this nature in the other Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, wherein the defunct Hero, hath acted without excuſe againſt the Churches Orders, to the great ſcandal of others who came to know it, and violating the preſcribed Rules of Decency, and Edification, which I ſuppoſe come under our Preacher's leſſer Matters, and when I conſider how notoriouſly He, and his Hero have acted in other inſtances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Juſtice, Mercy, Faith, and Charity, I cannot tell what he eſteems the great Truths and Duties of Chriſtianity, or the weightier Matters of the Law.</p>
            <p>But he <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 15.</note> tells us however that his <hi>UNBLEMISHED HERO ſaw with a deep regret the fatal Corruptions of this Age, while the Hypocriſies and Extravagancies of former times diſpoſed many to Atheiſm, and Impiety.</hi> But methinks he ſhould have ſaid nothing of the Hypocriſies, and Extravagancies of former Times, ſince they cannot but put men in mind of the Hypocriſies and Extravagancies of theſe, which for kind have been the ſame, and for degree, or <hi>Atrocity,</hi> as great as thoſe, and have alſo as much diſpoſed men to Atheiſm, and Impiety. Was it not rebelling under the Holy pretence of Religion? Was it not for taking God's Holy Name in vain in Faſts, and Thankſgivings to break his Holy Laws, and Judgements with a Popular ſhew of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that he means by the Hypocriſie of former Times, and have not the ſame things been done over again in theſe? And then as for the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62198:46"/> Extravagancies of thoſe former Times, does he not mean by them the proceeding ſo far under thoſe hypocritical Pretences, as firſt to riſe up in Arms againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the I. then to abdicate him in the Vote of <hi>Non addreſſes,</hi> then to murder him before his own Palace, and laſt of all, to defend thoſe <hi>Extravagancies</hi> under the ſame hypocritical Pretences, and magnifie thoſe, who did them, as our Deliverers, to whom we owed the conſervation of our Religion, Lives, and Liberties? And if this be his meaning, as in appearance it muſt, then I pray him to compare Times with Times, Facts with Facts, and Pretences with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and then to tell me, if as great Extravagancies have not been done in our days? And laſtly, as to diſpoſing men to Atheiſm, and Impiety, I appeal to the Conſciences of all ſerious obſerving men, if what hath been done, <hi>in, by,</hi> and <hi>ſince</hi> the Revolution, call it by what name you pleaſe, hath not diſpoſed many more to Atheiſm, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, than what he calls the Hypocriſies and Extravagancies of former Times.</p>
            <p>I have heard that in one of his Viſitation Speeches to the Clergy of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> he complained of the <hi>deluge of Atheiſm and Impiety that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed this Nation,</hi> and would to God he would lay his hand upon his heart, and conſider whether He, and his Hero, and his Hero's Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, have not among ſome others helped to ſet open the Floudgates to that overflowing Deludge, by what they have done under the irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretence of ſerving, and preſerving our Religion, by acting not only againſt the plaineſt Precepts of it, but the common notions of Juſtice, Truth, and Honeſty, and their own former Doctrines, which now bear witneſs againſt them, and will hereafter without Repentance, riſe up in Judgment againſt them, and condemn them, when our Lord ſhall ſay unto them, and every one that hath acted like them, <hi>out of thy Mouth,</hi> out of thy Writings, <hi>will I condemn thee, thou wicked Servant.</hi> In that day this will be the aggravation of their condemnation above the <hi>Marſhalls,</hi> the <hi>Calamies,</hi> the <hi>Owens,</hi> and the <hi>Goodwins</hi> of former Times, that they acted the ſame Iniquities againſt their own avowed Doctrins, and Principles, and Subſcriptions, whereby they had moſt publickly, frequently, and ſolemnly Anathematiz'd the Practiſes of thoſe men, and I will take upon me to ſay, that for any one Athieſt He, or his Hero converted before the Revolution, they have made ten ſince, and that if thoſe men ſlew their thouſands theſe have ſlain their ten thouſands, and I pray God, He and ſome others, who have time of Repentance yet left them, may conſider what I ſay before it is too late.</p>
            <p>It is ſcarce worth my pains to examine what he hath ſaid in the ſame page of the Deſign, that was laid (he means in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the II.) to make us firſt Athieſts, that we might more eaſily be made
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62198:46"/> Papiſts, this ſeems to be an odd deſign, at leaſt an odd way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, to make men Athieſts, that they may more eaſily be made Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that is, firſt to bring them to believe no Religion, that they may believe the Popiſh, and teach them to laugh at the three Creeds that they might believe all the Articles of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the IV. with all the ſupernumerary Traditions of the Roman Church. King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. indeed was not ſo careful as he ſhould have been in the great Concern of Religion, but that was to be imputed alſo to the Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and Extravagancies of former Times, which did with his Father, as theſe have done with his Brother, but to ſuggeſt that he laid a Deſign to make men Papiſts, by firſt making of them Athieſts, is as ridiculous as to ſay it now, when Atheiſm abounds much more than it did in his Reign. One may as reaſonably ſay, that he laid a deſign to make us firſt Papiſts, that he might more eaſily make us Rebels, or Socinians, as our Preacher hath been long made. But if by making us Papiſts, he means outward Profeſſors of Popery, I muſt tell him that King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. was too wiſe a Prince to think, that Athieſts could ever be brought to that in ſuch a Nation and Government as this, where no inquiſition, or force ſufficient to bring that about could be ſet up. For nothing leſs than a mighty force could make our Athieſts ſubmit to Popery, no, as they deſpiſe the ſpecial Doctrines of it, as much as any other men: So the liberties to which they are inur'd make them abhor, and deteſt it for the ſeverity of its Diſcipline, which they know will not allow them to practiſe their lewdneſs ſo openly, to curſe, damn, and blaſpheme, to call the Prieſthood Prieſtcraft, and to ridicule every thing that belongs to Religion, as they do now, and more than ever in the Houſes of our King; therefore we ſaw them not long ago as averſe to Popery, as other men, and aſſociating under the common pretence of preſerving our Religion with Enthuſiaſts, Hypocrites, and Apoſtates, nay with foreign mercenary Papiſts to drive a Sovereign Prince of that Communion, whoſe Title to the Crown depended not upon his Religion, out of all his Realms.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to examine the Libel he hath ſo maliciouſly made upon our ſuffering Clergy, and more eſpecially upon our ejected Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, where his want of Generoſity, and Charity appears in every Article of it, tho' but ſix lines before he pretends to write every thing in his Sermon with an Air free from Reſentment, but as I have ſhewed he writes many Falſehoods where he pretends to write ſtrict Truths: So where he pretends to write generouſly with candour, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſentment I always ſuſpect there is ſomething to follow of a quite different nature, and here I found, I was not diſappointed, I could tell him of ſome of his Hearers, and thoſe friends to the preſent Government who
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62198:47"/> that no man of Honour would have ſo treated men in affliction, as he did, and given ſuch an unreaſonable Teſtimony of an unmortified Temper in a Funeral Sermon, but let the Sermon be what it will, and let him pretend to write with never ſo much humanity, and ſweetneſs, I will lay of Natures ſide againſt him, becauſe his paſſions are ſo hard for him, that he cannot but ſhew his Nature, and mix his Choller with his Ink, when he ſhould write without reſentment as he hath done in this Libell with all the ill nature imaginable againſt the late Archbiſhop of venerable Memory, and the moſt worthy Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> whereof the former made him Doctor, when he could not make himſelf one, and the other as is ſtill remembred in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> moſt generouſly entertained him in his Lodging; at St. <hi>John</hi>'s Colledge, while he reſided in that Univerſity to inſpect Records eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>C. C. C.</hi> although at that time, he was in diſgrace at Court, and almoſt every where elſe. And it is a further aggravation of his ill-nature, that becauſe he had not, he took an occaſion of making this Libel againſt them, and their ſuffering Brethren; for after he had told his Hearers that the Defunct rejoyced in the happy deliverance of theſe Nations, then without any neceſſity, or connexion he tells us, that many of thoſe, who had long'd for it, and wiſht well to it, did of a ſudden ſtart back. It is plain here that by his many, he means many of the deprived Clergy, but if by his happy deliverance he means, as I have ſhewed he muſt, our pretended deliverance by the Revolution, I challenge him to name one of them, who long'd for it, or wiſhed well to it, for as many of thoſe, who have complied, abhorred the thoughts of it: So of thoſe, who have not complied, I know not one, but did, nor he neither I dare ſay. But then let us ſuppoſe that many of them long'd for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s coming, and wiſhed as well to it, as he himſelf did, might they not afterwards, nay were they not in Conſcience bound, when they ſaw their error, and his deſign, to ſtart back? What doth he mean by this Objection againſt: them? Muſt men go on in what they think iniquity, and as one of the Biſhops, who certainly long'd for the Revolution, ſaid, <hi>Over Shooes, over Boots.</hi> Is this too a Maxim of our Preacher, would he have men proceed from longing for a thing they thought good, to favouring and upholding it, when they found it ill, and from wiſhing well to it under one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, to acting for it under another? I believe he will make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to ſay that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> was in a great error for two years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether after the Revolution in refuſing ſo long to cloſe with it, and yet if he did well in cloſing at laſt with it, he ought not to be reproached for having ſtood out ſo long againſt it; although he ſaid to ſome Perſons of great honour, who conſulted him for his Opinion about taking the New Oath, <hi>That whoever took it would without repentance, as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62198:47"/> certainly burn in Hell-fire, as that fire,</hi> ſaith he, pointing to the Chimney, <hi>burns there,</hi> or to that effect. But beſides him who ſtood out ſo long, it would be eaſie to name many more, who neither longed for it, nor wiſhed well to it, that yet at laſt complied with it, and I hope he will not blame them for ſtarting from their firſt Reſolves, and coming in at the laſt hour of the day. For men are to be allowed the benefit of ſecond Thoughts, and of Repentance, which often times is the bleſſed effect of long and ſerious Conſideration; and when they turn Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents by the Laws of Honour, as well as Chriſtian Charity, their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer faults are to be buried in Oblivion, and never to be mentioned with reproach. Hath the great Hiſtorian of our Reformation forgotten what the firſt Archbiſhop of it did through Human Frailty, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repenting, died a Martyr, and put his right hand firſt in the Flames, becauſe that part of his Body ſhould be firſt puniſhed, which was firſt in fault.</p>
            <p>But to give other inſtances of ſtarting back nearer a kin to the matter in hand: In the Tragical Reign of <hi>Stephen,</hi> whom the Hiſtorians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent as a perjured Uſurper, <hi>Robert</hi> the great Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> through fear, and ſurprize took the Oath of Homage with the other Nobles to King <hi>Stephen,</hi> but not long after with ſome other Lords took an opportunity to renounce it, and let the Uſurper know by Word and Deed that he was aſhamed, and repented of the Homage he had done unto him contrary to his Allegiance to Queen <hi>Maud;</hi> and the Hiſtorians of thoſe Times Were ſo far from reproaching him with his firſt compliances, that they have celebrated his Memory upon the ſcore of his Repentance, and his conſtant Allegiance ever after to the Queen. In the Reign of <hi>Lovis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> whom the Barons ſet up in the room of King <hi>John,</hi> many Lords began to relent before he died, and many more after he was dead revolted from <hi>Lovis</hi> their own Idol, crowned the young Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the III. and ſoon made the Uſurper glad to compound for a ſafe conduct out of the Realm. In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. who, our Preacher ſaith in his Hiſtory of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>traiterouſly Uſurped the Crown,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Scroop,</hi> and many other Lords, who perhaps had longed for it, and for a while wiſhed well to it, afterwards ſaw their error and repented, and being reſolved to undo, as much as they could, what they had moſt unjuſtly done, they roſe up againſt <hi>Henry</hi> under the Title of Lord <hi>Henry Derby,</hi> and put out a moſt remarkable Remonſtrance againſt his Uſurpation, and an Excommunication againſt him, which may be ſeen in <hi>Foxe</hi>'s Acts, and Monuments of that Reign; and of which becauſe it is ſo ſcarce to be had, I have put an abridgment in the <note n="*" place="margin">N. VI.</note> Appendix: and in the Reign of his Grandſon <hi>Henry</hi> the VI. The whole Peerage
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62198:48"/> then aſſembled in a Parliament of that Prince's own calling, being made ſenſible of their error, and the injuſtice of their Anceſtors in depoſing <hi>Richard</hi> the II. and ſetting up <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. declared upon <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Claim by Birth-right, and proximity of Blood, that his Title could not be defeated, but that the Crown of Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to him: this with all that was done thereupon may be ſeen in <hi>Roll. Parl.</hi> 39. <hi>Henry VI. N.</hi> 10. as it is in <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Abridgement put out by Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> or rather in the Record at large, as it is Printed in the 31 page of the <note n="*" place="margin">An Enquiry into the remarkable inſtances of Hiſtory and Parliament Records uſed by the Author of the Unreaſonableneſs of a new Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether they are faithfully ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and applied.</note> Book mentioned in the Margent, and I mention it, becauſe I think it, as well as the Book in which it is Printed, worthy to be read of all men. And what another Parliament 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> IV. declared againſt the Uſurpation of the three <hi>Henries</hi> as againſt God's Law, Man's Allegiance, and unnatural in its ſelf. I need not recite here, becauſe it is to be ſeen in the Printed Statutes of that Reign. And in our Preachers <hi>former times of Hypocriſie,</hi> the Times of the great Rebellion, which began in 41: many Perſons of Honour and Quality in both Kingdoms, who were concern'd in the Prologue, or firſt Scenes, or Acts of that bloody Tragedy, being afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their Errors, not only ſtarted back, and repented, but brought forth Fruits meet for ſuch Repentance, and I need but name the Great <hi>Montroſe,</hi> his Patron the <hi>Duke of Lauderdale,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henderſon</hi> of his own Country as Examples of what I ſay; and the two Heroick Penitents the Lords <hi>Hepton</hi> and <hi>Capell</hi> both of Immortal Memory in ours. The former of theſe Lords, as Report ſaith, went with a Rope about his Neck as a Token of his Repentance, to throw himſelf at the King's Feet, and how they both after repentance ſignaliz'd themſelves in his ſervice, and the Lord <hi>Capell</hi> in his Son's, is known ſo well, that I need not relate it. So <hi>William Pryn,</hi> not to mention all the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, who were ſent to treat with the King at <hi>Holmby</hi>-Houſe ſtarted back alſo, though it is to be wiſhed they had done it ſooner, and how ſeverely he cenſured his old Actions, and endeavoured to undo what he had done, may be ſeen from what he hath written in his Plea for the Lords, his <hi>Concordia Diſcors,</hi> and a Paragraph or two, in his Preface to <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Abridgment which I have alſo put in the <note n="†" place="margin">N. VI.</note> Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix. Nay the Members of that very Convention which called home <hi>Charles</hi> the II. were the men that began and carried on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt his Father, and yet by God's Grace they ſtarted ſo far back, as to declare point blank againſt their former Practiſe, <hi>that by the undoubted, and fundamental Laws of this Kingdom; neither the Peers of this Realm, nor the Commons, nor both together, nor the People collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62198:48"/> nor repreſentatively, nor any other Perſons whatſoever ever had, have, or ought to have any Coercive Power over the Perſons of the Kings of this Realm.</hi> And ſometime before that, when the King was in his return, the Lords and Commons of that Convention, together with the Lord Mayor, Common Council-men, and Freemen of <hi>London,</hi> in a <note n="*" place="margin">Appen. N. VII.</note> Proclamation did declare, <q>That His Majeſty's Rights, and Titles to his Kingdoms were, every way compleat by the death of his Royal Father without the Ceremony or Solemnity of a Proclamation, and that the Imperial Crown of this Realm did by inherent Birth right deſcend to him, as next lineal, and rightful Heir of the Blood Royal.</q> Here are ſta<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ters back with a witneſs, and I hope their ſtarting back from a Cauſe in which they were ſo long engaged, was neither a reproach to them, nor an argument for the goodneſs, but the intollerable illneſs thereof. And ſo if any of our ſuffering Clergy did, as he affirms, long for the Revolution, and wiſh well to it, their ſtarting back ſhews no more than that they were miſlead in the Croud, and afterwards thought otherwiſe of it, than they did at the firſt. Therefore God is to be praiſed, and they commended that they <hi>ſtarted back</hi> ſo ſoon, and proceeded no further with relucting conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as many others unhappily did. I could tell of one now in the higheſt place of the Church, who ſaid ſometime after the Revolution, ſaid to this effect, That it was one entire piece of iniquity, and after that again in the plural Phraſe, That <hi>we,</hi> and by conſequence he had gone too far, and yet he goes on ſtill, and I fear will not <hi>ſtart back.</hi> Others I could name to their honour, who proceeded ſo far, as to take the Oath, and to comply for ſometime after, but ſince, God be praiſed, have ſtarted back, and offered like true Penitents, to do pennance, and begg'd Abſolution for what they thought ſo grievous a ſin, and now I have told it, let our Preacher make what he can of their <hi>ſtarting back,</hi> but when Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> ſtarted from the other ſide, to which theſe men went back, I never heard that he had the leaſt remorſe for continuing ſo long in his great error, as he muſt acknowledge it to have been, much leſs that he was willing to do pennance for it (beſides the pennance he did in Print) or deſired the Abſolution of the Church.</p>
            <p>After this he proceeds to tell us, that <hi>ſome in high Stations</hi> (that is ſome Biſhops) <hi>of the Church would neither openly declare for it, nor againſt it according to the authority of their Characters: one of which certainly they ought to have done: if they did then judge it ſo unlawful, as they would now repreſent it, they ought to have thunder'd both with their Sermons, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures against it, eſpecially in the firſt Fermentation, when a vigorous oppoſition might have had conſiderable effects, and would have made them look like Confeſſors indeed, to which they afterwards pretended.</hi> Here our Preacher
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62198:49"/> reflects upon our ſuffering Fathers for not having declared, and acted againſt the Revolution betimes, and <hi>thunders</hi> againſt them for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thundered with their Sermons and Cenſures againſt, in the firſt Fermentation, <hi>i. e.</hi> when the Mob were Maſters in all places, and would have tore them in pieces for it, as ſome of them were threatned, and that indeed would have been a <hi>conſiderable effect.</hi> This puts me in mind of the Queſtion he ſo often asked Mr. <hi>Napleton</hi> of <hi>Feverſham, Why did you not let the King go?</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Napleton</hi> made anſwer the firſt time to this purpoſe, Sir, <hi>We could not govern the Rabble, and if the King had offered to go, they would have torn him in pieces.</hi> After ſome time the good Dr. asked Mr. <hi>Napleton</hi> again, <hi>Why did you not let the King go? I told you Sir,</hi> replied Mr. <hi>Napleton, becauſe the Rabble would have torn him in pieces, if he had offer'd to go.</hi> And after that again, a third time, <hi>Why did you not let the King go?</hi> Sir, replied Mr. <hi>Napleton,</hi> with ſome emotion, <hi>I have told you twice, becauſe if he had offered to go, the Rabble would have murdered him;</hi> Eigh, but Mr. <hi>Napleton,</hi> ſaith he again, <hi>You ſhould have let him go, i. e.</hi> as Mr. <hi>Napleton</hi> apprehended, and all others muſt, you ſhould have let him been murdered by the People: This account I had from a Gentleman in whoſe hearing Mr. <hi>Napleton</hi> told the Story; and ſo here in like manner, he ſaith, they ſhould have thunder'd with their Sermons, and Cenſures againſt the Revolution in the firſt Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when the <hi>Mob</hi> were the fermenting Particles, that they might have been torn in pieces, or knocked in the head. The <hi>Non</hi> comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops are as it were ſo many living Records againſt him, and how glad would he have been, that they had been martyred in the <hi>firſt Fermentation,</hi> that might not have been <hi>Confeſſors</hi> now, and now alive to reproach him with their Teſtimony and Sufferings. <hi>They did it not,</hi> ſaith he, and God, and they be thanked, ſay I, that <hi>they did it not</hi> out of Seaſon; for there is a time to ſuffer, and a time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Suffering, a time to ſpeak as <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> and a time to keep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, a time to die Martyrs, and a time to fly from Martyrdom; and our Spiritual Guides and Paſtors were Judges of the Seaſon, God having left much to their prudence to act and ſuffer, or to forbear acting in ſome times and places, that they may not ſuffer, as to them ſhall ſeem expedient moſt for God's Glory, and the preſervation of his Church. For it is in the ſpiritual, as it is in the ſecular Warfare, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Souldiers of Chriſt, but eſpecially the Leaders muſt Husband their Lives more than at other times, and ſometimes Spiritual Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence directs them to be as it were prodigal, and ſometimes to be ſparing of their Blood. Would it have been wiſdom in <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> when there were ſo few faithful Biſhops, to have <hi>thunder'd</hi> with his Sermons againſt the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie before the <hi>Arrian</hi> Mob of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:62198:49"/> when it was much fitter for him to fly from their rage, that he might reſerve himſelf for better times, and in the interim direct, and encourage the faithful, and live to ſettle the Church in its former State. Let us hear what he ſaith in his own vindication, for not <hi>acting accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Authority of his Character, and not thundering with Sermons, and Cenſures</hi> in his Province, when he might have made a <hi>vigorous oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> but fled to ſave his Life. <hi>When they charge us with fear,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they conſider not that this reflects upon themſelves, who gave occaſion for it; for if it be a fault to fly, it is a much greater to perſecute— If they reproach us for</hi> hiding <hi>our ſelves from thoſe, who ſeek to take away our Lives, and for flying from the Perſecutors, what will they ſay to</hi> Jacob, <hi>who fled from his Brother</hi> Eſau, <hi>or to</hi> Moſes, <hi>who departed into the Land of</hi> Madian <hi>for fear of</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>or to</hi> David <hi>who fled from</hi> Saul? <hi>What would they ſay to the Great</hi> Elias, <hi>who hid himſelf becauſe of</hi> Ahab, <hi>and fled becauſe of</hi> Jezabell<hi>'s</hi> Threatnings, <hi>as the Sons of the Prophets were alſo by Fifties in Caves. The Diſciples of our Lord hid themſelves for fear of the Jews, and</hi> Paul <hi>at</hi> Damaſcus <hi>being ſought for by the Governour, was let down from the Wall in a Basket, and ſo eſcaped his hands. The Law appointed Cities of refuge to flee unto for the ſafety of thoſe who were ſought for to be put to death, but in theſe laſt Times that</hi> Word <hi>of the Father who ſpake before to</hi> Moſes, <hi>gave Commandment, that, when his Diſciples were perſecuted in one City, they ſhould</hi> flee <hi>unto another.—This the Saints knew, and managed themſelves accordingly— And this is the Rule for men to attain perfection, namely to do what God commands. Hence the</hi> Word <hi>himſelf, who became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate for us, when he was ſought for, thought it not amiſs to</hi> hide <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as we do, or to</hi> fly <hi>from Perſecution. When he was a Child he warned</hi> Joſeph <hi>by an Angel to ariſe, and take the young Child, and his Mother, and fly into</hi> Egypt. <hi>And after</hi> Herod<hi>'s death he went aſide into</hi> Nazareth, <hi>becauſe of</hi> Archelaus. <hi>When he had cured the withered hand, and the Pharaſees took counſel to kill him, he departed thence, and when he had rais'd</hi> Lazarus <hi>from the dead, and was in danger by it, he walked no more openly among the</hi> Jews, <hi>but departed thence into the Wilderneſs. And when the</hi> Jews <hi>took up Stones to caſt at him for affirming himſelf to have been before</hi> Abraham, <hi>he hid himſelf, and went out of the Temple, and paſſing through the midſt of them, made his eſcape. When</hi> John <hi>had ſuffered Martyrdom, and his Diſciples had buried his Body, Jeſus hearing of it withdrew himſelf, took Ship, and went privately into a Deſart place:</hi> What therefore is thus written of our Saviour, is written for the common benefit of Mankind. He would not permit himſelf to be apprehended before his time came, nor would any longer hide himſelf, when once it was come, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf to thoſe, who came to take him—Being perſecuted they fled, and ſaved themſelves by lying cloſe, but if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62198:50"/> to be diſcovered, they were ready to ſuffer Martyrdom for the Faith.</p>
            <p>Thus far the Great <hi>Athanaſius</hi> by way of Apology for his <hi>flying,</hi> and <hi>abſconding,</hi> and it is, every word of it, as good a juſtification of our ſuffering Fathers, for not <hi>openly declaring, and acting,</hi> and for not <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>thundering</hi> in the <hi>firſt Fermentation,</hi> when the Mob, not to name other Perſons, were more terrible than <hi>Eſau,</hi> or <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or <hi>Ahab,</hi> or <hi>Jezabel,</hi> or <hi>Herod,</hi> or the <hi>Jews,</hi> to which they were ſo like in every reſpect. Wherefore in all appearance, if our Fathers had declared and acted then, we had not had the comfort, and benefit of them now, but had been left like Sheep without a Shepherd. And tho' to have died, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in Martyrdom would have been gain, and advantage to them, and really far better than to live in ſuch wretched times, yet their abiding in the fleſh, was, and is more needful for us, and for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and preſervation of the Church.</p>
            <p>But then ſuppoſe that we ſhould admit, which we have no reaſon to do, that they were defective in their duty through fear, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, or other human frailties, in the firſt, ſudden, and fearful Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which ſo ſmall a number could not ſtand againſt: Is not this a common and venial Infirmity? Did not <hi>Peter</hi> in a ſurprize of fear deny his Maſter; and the reſt fly? And yet he, and all of them lived Confeſſors, and died Martyrs after. Have not many of the moſt celebrated Confeſſors and Martyrs, been at ſome time overcome with this human infirmity, eſpecially upon ſudden Revolutions, and violent Fermentations, when the Faithful could ſcarce know their Brethren, and who would be true, and who falſe? And therefore if this had indeed been the caſe of our ſuffering Fathers, it is ſo common, not only to Human Nature, but ſometimes to the beſt men of it, that I would not reverence them, or their Memory after them, one jot the leſs upon that account. No man pretends to reverence the Memory of Father <hi>Paul</hi> more than our Preacher doth in his Life of <hi>Bedell,</hi> and in his <hi>Travells,</hi> altho' the Father was ſo timerous, that he durſt not make one publick ſtep towards a Reformation, or do one Heroick act in order to it. He would indeed often commend the Scriptures in his Sermons to the People, and once holding a <hi>Greek</hi> Teſtament in one hand, while he clapt it with the other, <hi>This, this,</hi> ſaith he, is <hi>the Book, of Life,</hi> with more to that purpoſe. This occaſioned a Gentleman to go to him, and expoſtulate with him upon his Sermon, how he could ſo recommend that Book, and yet act ſo contrary to it every day, but eſpecially in his ſolemn Maſſes, to which he replied burſting out into tears, <hi>Deus non mihi dedit Spiritum Lutheri. God hath not given me the Spirit of Luther.</hi> And I queſtion not, but if God had ſeen it fit that our
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62198:50"/> ſuffering Fathers ſhould have <hi>thundered</hi> in the firſt Fermentation, he would have poured out the <hi>Spirit of might</hi> upon them, and given them a thundering courage from above, which all their Adverſaries, and all their Captains of Fifties, and Hundreds had not been able to reſiſt. But this I ſay again was not their caſe, becauſe they acted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtanding Rules of Spiritual Wiſdom, and the liberty that God hath allow'd in all Perſecutions, where he is not pleaſed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by inſpired courage, and thereby over-rule the Spirits of Men. Wherefore it was not a Seaſon for them then to <hi>thunder,</hi> eſpecially with Cenſures: To have done ſo againſt Foreigners, would have been to no purpoſe, becauſe they were of other Communions, and to have thundered againſt our own People, would have been to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Multitude, which is againſt the Rules, and directions of the Canon Law.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, he ſaith, <hi>They left their authority entirely with their Chancellors, who acting in their name, and by their Commiſſion, were the ſame perſons in Law with themſelves, and that Oaths, which they thought unlawful, were tender'd to others, and taken by them in their name.</hi> This Expreſſion of leaving their authority with their Chancellors is ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, either ſignifying, that they gave ſpecial Orders, and Commiſſion upon that occaſion to give Inſtitution, and to Adminiſter the Oath, or that the Chancellors having thoſe Powers in their Patents before, as moſt Chancellors had, gave Inſtitutions, and Adminiſtred the Oaths by their Patent Power, when thoſe Biſhops would not. If the former be meant by him, then I confeſs, if any of them did ſo, they did amiſs, and what they cannot, nor I believe, will undertake to juſtifie, but meekly acknowledge their Error, which their haughty Cenſour is not apt to do. But upon the beſt inquiry, I have had the opportunity to make, I cannot find, that one of them did ſo, and if our Preacher knows of any one that did, he may name him, when he pleaſes. But if the later be only meant by him, then they are not to be blamed for what they could not hinder their Chancellors from doing, who indeed are but too much one Perſon in Law with them, as Dr. <hi>Duck,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Wells,</hi> ſhew'd Dr. <hi>Peirce</hi> the Biſhop of that Dioceſs many years ago. How could they hinder their Chancellors from Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Oaths, who were more officious to the Government then them, and who having not the conſcience, nor courage to ſuffer with them, were willing to ſignalize their good Intentions to it, whether they would or no? It is very well known how the firſt Thankſgiving Books, and all the Faſt, and Thankſgiving Offices afterwards, were ſent to their Chancellors, Officialls, or Regiſters to be diſtributed about their Dioceſſes without them, and for this reaſon he might as well have ſaid that Faſts, and Thankſgivings were obſerved by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62198:51"/> their order, and direction, although they thought them unlawful.</p>
            <p>Then it follows, <hi>That though they thought the Oaths unlawful, yet they would ſcarce ſay ſo much in confidence to any of their Clergy, that asked their opinions about it, both concealing their Principles, and withdrawing from the Publick Worſhip, and yet not daring to act, or ſpeak againſt it.</hi> At what a rate doth he juggle here: They would ſcarcely ſay ſo much, but it ſeems they did ſay it, and they would ſcarcely ſay ſo much in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when the Perſons that asked them their Opinions of the Oaths were it may be in their Opinions, Perſons not be confided in. Indeed they had need be upon their guard at that time, but more eſpecially the Archbiſhop, the Perſon whom he means, had reaſon to ſuſpect that ſome of the Clergy, and others came to entrap him, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did our Saviour. I have heard him complain of it, and therefore his common anſwer to ſome, whom he ſuſpected, or knew not, was to this effect: <hi>What need you come to me to ask my Opinion, the World knows it, and my Practice declares it, and you knew it before you came; and if it be my reaſons, that you would ask me, then let this one ſuffice, I cannot take contrary Oaths.</hi> But where he had confidence in Perſons, no man ſpoke more or better upon the Subject, as many are ready to atteſt. And I would ask our Preacher, how could the notoriety of his Practice, and particularly his withdrawing from Publick Worſhip, be conſiſtent with concealing his Principles; which not only the Learned, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned knew; Captain <hi>Tom</hi>'s Regiment, and the <hi>Watermen</hi> knew them, as well as the Biſhops and the Clergy, and thoſe, who forſooth went to him, to ask his opinion about the Oath, might as well have asked him what Religion he was of, for the one was as well known as the other.</p>
            <p>Then he tells, That <hi>they hoped at this rate to have held their Sees, and enjoy'd their Revenues, while in a ſilent, but fearful manner, they ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to an Intereſt, which, as one of them wrote, they could no more part with, than with their Intereſt in Heaven.</hi> The very reverend, and worthy Prelate, who ſaid that, did neither in a ſilent, or fearful manner adhere to that Intereſt, for it is very well known with what boldneſs, and danger too, he preached up our duty as Subjects at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Places of his Dioceſs immediately before the <hi>firſt Fermentation,</hi> not to mention the Intereſt he eſpouſed in the Convention. But I believe he more eſpecially means the Archbiſhop, who never came to ſpeak his mind there; but nothing can be more abſurd than to aſcribe it to a deſign of holding his Revenues: firſt becauſe no man ever deſpiſed them more, eſpecially in compariſon of his Duty; and ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he muſt needs know, that coming, or not coming to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, he could not hold his See long, if a new Government were ſet up. The Reaſons will one day be told, why he would not come
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62198:51"/> thither; it was not fear, but conſcience, and a real perſuaſion, that his appearance there would do no good, which made him decline coming to a Meeting, which he thought was ſo illegally, and unauthorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively called.</p>
            <p>Then it follows, <hi>Thus did they abandon the Government of the Church,</hi> and I will ſay juſt as the King abandoned, and relinquiſhed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or as a man abandons his Houſe, that is driven from it by force of Arms. Is not this a modeſt way of repreſenting matter of fact, and doth it not excellently well become an Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian to call <hi>ſuſpending</hi> and <hi>ejecting, Abandoning?</hi> The word might perhaps have paſſed in the next Age, but no man beſides our Preacher would have called it ſo now, that is not <hi>Abandoned</hi> by Modeſty, and the love of Truth.</p>
            <p>Then it follows, <hi>We were in ſuch a Poſture by their means, that neither our Laws, nor our Princes could bear it long.</hi> What our Princes would, or could have born in that Affair, I cannot determine, but it is well known, how they were importuned after the Victor's return from the <hi>Boyn,</hi> by our Preacher and others of his Robe, to put other Biſhops into the places of the deprived, or perhaps it might have been longer before the Schiſm had been commenced. The writ of Intruſion was alſo deviſed, and prepared in order to this <hi>good Work,</hi> and the pleaſure his <hi>Hero</hi> took in the Invention of that Expedient ſhews, that he was not ſo incapable, as he <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 29.</note> makes him of craft, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and that there was <hi>ſomething in the</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 27.</note> 
               <hi>World he thought worth much art,</hi> and <hi>great management,</hi> namely to get Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an Archbiſhoprick worth five thouſand pounds a year. But then as for our Laws they would have born with it, as long as our Princes pleaſed, for it is a Maxim in our Conſtitution, which our Preacher (if he knew) forgot, or diſſembled, that <hi>nullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> and whether it had not been more for the honour of our Church, and the reputation of our Religion to have deferred filling up the Sees of our ſuffering Fathers, till their deaths had really made them vacant, I leave any indifferent Perſon to judge. I am ſure Dioceſſes have been longer kept vacant, than that in probability would have been, in the beſt Reigns, and for leſs important Reaſons, and if the like forbearance had been practiſed now, this Schiſm, this horrible and unnatural Schiſm had been prevented, nor had we loſt the unvaluable advantage we had before over our Adverſaries, by now having, as they have had, Biſhop againſt Biſhop, and Pope againſt Pope.</p>
            <p>And then to conclude all, ſaith he, moſt triumphantly: <hi>Therefore the ſame authority made their Sees void, that had diſplaced the Non-conformiſts in</hi> 61. <hi>and the Popiſh Biſhops in the beginning of Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s Reign.</hi> That it was the ſame authority, which diſplaced the Popiſh Biſhops in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, and the Non-conformiſts in 61. every true
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62198:52"/> Engliſhman will confeſs; but that <hi>that</hi> Authority, and <hi>this,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived our ſuffering Fathers is the ſame, a great part of the Nation, who are as well verſed in our Antiquities, Hiſtories, Records, and Laws, as any other men, and have ſtudied our Conſtitution to inform their Conſciences, as every one knows, utterly deny; ſo that our Preacher's aſſerting <hi>that</hi> Authority and this to be the ſame, without proving it, is precarious and ſignifies juſt nothing at all. I will not take upon me to be a Judge in this Controverſie, for it is above my Sphere, but only ſet down ſome Obſervations; which I have made in reading Books on both ſides. Firſt then as to the Authority of our Hereditary Kings, I obſerve, firſt, that thoſe who in former Reigns have maintained the Cauſe of our Non Hereditary Princes, never had the confidence to deny it, but the other ſide have always taken upon them to deny their <hi>Power</hi> to be <hi>Authority,</hi> becauſe in their opinion it wanted Right. Secondly, I have obſerved, that the Arguments, or rather Argument for the Authority of our Hereditary Kings is in all Writers of all Reigns, and Ages one, and the ſame, but in other Writers various, different and inconſiſtent one with another, and as for this Government, our Preacher advanced one Argument for it in his <hi>Paſtoral Letter,</hi> for which the Houſe of Commons damned the whole Book to the Flames, where all the other Arguments for taking the Oath, but Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Providential Right were burnt together with <hi>Conqueſt</hi> by the hand of the common Hangman. Thirdly, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that many Uſurpers of this Kingdom, have notwithſtanding all their other patched Titles, pretended alſo to <hi>Birth-right,</hi> as the beſt of all, and I appeal to the beſt Friends of the preſent Government, if they would not moſt willingly exchange all their other Titles for that, as the Fox in the Fable, who when he was hotly purſued by the Hounds would have given all his <hi>ſhifts,</hi> which he proudly reckoned up but a little before, for that ſingle one of the Cat. And how much it once prevailed above all the reſt, upon the moſt ſolemn hearing, that ever was on both ſides in any Kingdom, may be ſeen in <hi>Roll. Par.</hi> 39 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. <hi>n.</hi> 10. which I cited before, and once more recommend to the Reader, and to our Preacher too. But which ſoever of the two is the beſt ſide of the Controverſie, it did not become him of all men in the Kingdom, to affirm thoſe Authorities to be the ſame, who had declared <hi>Henry</hi> IV. to be an Uſurper, and the meeting of a Convention without the King's Writ to be an <hi>Eſſential Nullity;</hi> and who likewiſe in his third Diſcourſe, deliver'd to his Clergy concerning <hi>the infallibility, and authority of the Church,</hi> declares that in all Conſtitutions among men, the moſt evident thing, is this, <hi>where the ſupream Authority reſts, that there ſhould be no danger of miſtaking,</hi> and where, and in whom it evidently reſts by our conſtitutions, thoſe who have read the many recognition Acts in our Statute Book, and the Oath of Supremacy may eaſily tell.</p>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:62198:52"/>
            <p>But then in the ſecond place, let us ſuppoſe thoſe Authorities to be the ſame, yet it doth not follow, that the Caſes of the <hi>Deprivations</hi> are the ſame too. For the ſame lawful Authority may in one Reign deprive juſtly, and in another unjuſtly; ſometimes it may make good, and ſometimes it may enact wicked Laws; ſometimes puniſh evil-doers, and ſometimes puniſh well-doers, and baniſh, deprive, or <hi>premunire</hi> Men, or put them to death for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well as for breaking the Commandments of God, and for adhereing to Truth, Juſtice, and common Honeſty, which are the Ligaments of all Human Communions, as well as for acting againſt them, and the plain Maxims of Right and Wrong, which are engraven upon the Conſciences of Men. Our Preacher therefore ſhould not only have aſſerted the Authorities depriving to be the ſame, but the Cauſes, and Reaſons of the Deprivations to have been the ſame too; but this he hath not had aſſurance enough to do, and therefore for any thing he hath written to the contrary, the Deprivation of our ſuffering Biſhops and Clergy may be unjuſt, and wicked, and a direful perſecution, and they as much <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> for Righteouſneſs, Truth, and common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, as he ſaith, they now <hi>pretend to be:</hi> There are ſuch Apologies, and Defences written for them, that I proteſt, if I were their moſt implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemy, as I fear our Preacher is, I could not tell how to anſwer them, and till they are anſwer'd, they, and thoſe, who hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, and wiſh well to them, will preſume the Truth to be on their ſide. This I ſay upon ſuppoſition, that the Authority which deprived them is as lawful, as our Preacher can wiſh it, but if it ſhould be otherwiſe, as it may be for any thing he hath ſaid to the contrary, then upon this ſuppoſition, I believe he will not deny, but that as Chriſtians they ſuffer Perſecution, and tyrannical Oppreſſion as Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Subjects of this Realm.</p>
            <p>Further, there is ſomething more in this matter, which the deprived inſiſt upon with great force of Reaſon, and that is the want of Validity in any Civil Authority whatſoever to <hi>deprive Biſhops,</hi> a point which Dr. <hi>Hody</hi> the chief Vindicator of the preſent Deprivations hath not yet ventured upon, though he hath <note n="*" place="margin">See his Preface to the Caſe of the Sees va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant stated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> promiſed a particular Treatiſe of it, and he is earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to <hi>reſerve</hi> it no longer, that the moſt Learned and Pious Vindication of the <hi>deprived Biſhops,</hi> who hath long expected it, may return an anſwer to both.</p>
            <p>Having now ended my third Chapter, I ſhould proceed in a <hi>fourth,</hi> to cenſure the Stile of our Preacher with the ſame freedom, that he hath taken upon him to cenſure that of ſo many other Writers, and moſt of them greater men, than himſelf. The Stile of Dr. <hi>Lowth,</hi> who is a much greater Divine, is in his account rough, and ſhaggy; his Author <hi>Lactantius</hi> wrote not in a ſtile becoming an Hiſtorian;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62198:53"/> 
               <hi>Varillas</hi> his Periods, though they had their Beauties, yet were but whipt Cream; <hi>Maimbourgh</hi>'s Writings ſmelt of <hi>Champaigne,</hi> and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Le Grand,</hi> whoſe learning is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his name, wrote like an <note n="*" place="margin">Si Monſieur <hi>Burnet</hi> avoit vû les deux concluſions qui ſont à la fin de la De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe de <hi>Sanderus,</hi> &amp; de la reſutation des deux premiers Livres de la Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, il auroit raiſon de dire, qu'en ces endroits là, le Stile de Monſieur <hi>Le Grand,</hi> eſt le Stile dùn Avocat, &amp; d'un Avocat vehement, qui gourmande furieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſement ſa partie.

No Stile of any ſort of Writers, plain or poliſhed, courſe or fine, can pleaſe him in any Language; be they Engliſh or Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Proteſtants or Papiſts, Divines or Lawyers if they are his Adverſaries, they cannot eſcape his inſolent Cenſure.

               <hi>Style is exact, neither ſinking nor ſwelling, plain, diſtinct, ſhort, clear, all of one piece, without ſuperfluity of Words, ſuperficial Strains, falſe Thoughts, or bold Flights; all ſolid, yet lively, and grave, as well as free. The</hi> Wilkinſes <hi>and</hi> Tillotſons, that are for the <hi>Liberties of Mankind,</hi> and have <hi>large Thoughts</hi> of things, thoſe who are their own Patterns, and above the Examples of former Times, they ſhall all have the higheſt Characters; they are all Patterns for the World to follow; but the men of ſtrict Principles, the <hi>narrow, the hot, the warm, the angry, and the peeviſh men,</hi> are unaccurate, and little Writers, that underſtand <hi>true Eloquence</hi> as little, as the <hi>juſt freedoms of Human Nature.</hi> Nor have they any thing of Propriety, Beauty, or Strength of Stile, when they happen to write againſt him. But notwithſtanding all the provocations he hath given to examine the Stile of his Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſhew how incongruous it is to the Occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and boyiſh in affectation of Words; and Phraſes, I will not ſpend my time, and Paper in an undertaking ſo unſuitable to my Genius, but leave it to the Wits, and Criticks of the Town, and particularly to the fourth Perſon of the Conference mentioned in the <hi>Introduction,</hi> who will not act againſt the Rules of Honour, if they call him, and other haughty Writers to the teſt of Eloquence, and by the <hi>ſeverity</hi> of a ſtrict Cenſure expoſe their Writings, as much as it is their common practice to expoſe other mens. For my own part, as I am ſenſible of many defects in my own Stile, ſo I ſeldom cenſure other mens, always minding more what is written, than the manner of writing of it, and the truth, weight, and congruity of things in Sermons, and all other Tracts, more than the Stile in which the Author ſets them before his Reader; and where there is no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the former, or none juſt or matterial, I always conceal the defects I think there may be in the later.</p>

                     <salute>My Lord.</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Was heartily glad to ſee your Lordſhip this Morning in that calm and devout temper at the Receiving of the Bleſſed Sacrament; but Peace of mind, unleſs it be well-grounded, will avail little: And becauſe tranſient Diſcourſe many times hath little effect for want of time to weigh and conſider it, therefore in tender compaſſion of your Lordſhips Caſe, and from all the good will that one Man can bear to another, <hi>I</hi> do humbly offer to your Lordſhips deliberate thoughts theſe following Conſiderations concerning the points of Reſiſtance, If our Religion and Rights ſhould be invaded, as your Lordſhip puts the Caſe, concerning which I underſtand by Dr. <hi>B.</hi> that your Lordſhip had once received Satisfaction, and am ſorry to find a change.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Chriſtian Religion doth plainly forbid the Reſiſtance of Authority.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That though our Religion be Eſtabliſhed by Law, (which your Lordſhip urges as a difference between our Caſe, and that of the Primitive Chriſtians) yet in the ſame Law which Eſtabliſhes our Religion it is declared. That it is not Lawful upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to take up Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides that there is a particular Law declaring the Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> to be ſolely in the King. And that ties the hands of Subjects, though the Law of Nature and the General Rules of Scripture had left us at liberty; which I believe they do not, becauſe the Government and Peace of Humane Society could not well ſubſiſt upon theſe Terms.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Your Lordſhips opinion is contrary to the declared Doctrin of all Proteſtant Churches; and though ſome particular Perſons have taught otherwiſe, yet they have been contradicted herein and condemned for it by the Generality of Proteſtants, And I beg your Lordſhip to conſider how it will agree with an avowed aſſerting of the Proteſtant Religion, to go contrary to the General Doctrin of Proteſtants. My end in this is to convince your Lordſhip that you are in a very Great and Dangerous Miſtake, and being ſo convinced that which before was a Sin of Ignorance, will appear of much more heinous Nature, as in Truth it is, and call for a very particular and deep Repentance; which if your Lordſhip ſincerely exerciſe upon the ſight of your Error, by a Penitent Acknowledgment of it to God
<pb facs="tcp:62198:55"/> and Men, you will not only obtain Forgiveneſs of God, but prevent a mighty Scandal to the Reformed Religion. I am very loath to give your Lordſhip any diſquiet in the Diſtreſs you are in, which I commiſerate from my heart, but am much more concerned that you do not leave the World in a Deluſion and falſe Peace, to the hindrance of your Eternal Happineſs. I heartily Pray for you, and beſeech your Lordſhip to believe that I am with the greateſt Sincerity and Compaſſion in the World,</p>

               <hi>IN the Name of God, Amen.</hi> Before the Lord <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> Judge of the Quick and Dead, We long ſince became bound by Oath upon the ſacred Evangelical Book unto our Sovereign Lord <hi>Richard,</hi> late King of <hi>England,</hi> That we as long as we lived ſhall bear true Allegiance, and fidelity towards him and his Heirs ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the Kingdom by juſt Title, Right, and Line according to the Statutes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of this Realm; have here taken unto us certain Articles ſubſcribed in form following, to be proponed, heard, and tryed before the juſt Judge, Chriſt Jeſus, and the whole World. But if (which God forbid) by force, Fear, or violence of wicked Perſons, we ſhall be caſt in Priſon, or by violent Death be prevented, ſo as in this world we ſhall not be able to prove the ſaid Articles as we wiſh; Then we do appeal to the high Celeſtial Judge, that he may judge and diſcern the ſame in the day of his ſupream Judgment. Firſt, we depoſe, ſay, and except, and intend to prove againſt <hi>Henry Darby,</hi> commonly called King of <hi>England,</hi> (himſelf pretending the ſame, but without all Right and Title thereunto) and againſt his adherents, fautors, Complices, that they have ever been, are, and will be Traytors, Invaders, and Deſtroyers of God's Church, and of our Sovereign Lord <hi>Richard,</hi> late King of <hi>England,</hi> his heirs, his Kingdom, and Common-wealth, as ſhall hereafter manifeſtly appear— In the Second Article they declare him Forſworn, Prejured, and Excommunicate, for that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt his Sovereign Lord King <hi>Richard.</hi> In the Fourth they recite by what wrong, illegall, and falſe means he exalted himſelfe into the Throne of of the Kingdom; and then deſcribing the miſerable State of the Nation, which followed after his Uſurpation, they again pronounce him Perjured and Excommunicate. In the Fifth Article they ſet forth in what a Barbarous and inhuman manner. <hi>Henry</hi> and his Accomplices Impriſoned and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <hi>K. Richard,</hi> and then cry out, wherefore O <hi>England!</hi> ariſe, ſtand up and avenge the Cauſe, the Death and injury of thy King and Prince: If thou do not, take this for certain that the Righteous God will Deſtroy thee by ſtrange Invaſions, and foreign Power, and avenge himſelf on thee for this ſo horrible an Act. In The Seventh they depoſe againſt him for putting to Death not only Lords Spiritual, and other Religious Men, but alſo divers of the Lords Temporal there Named; for which they pronounce him Excommunicate. In the Ninth they ſay, and depoſe, that the Realm of <hi>England</hi> never Flouriſhed, nor Proſpered after he Tyrannically took upon him the Government of it. And in the Laſt they Depoſe and proteſt for themſelves, and <hi>K. Richard</hi> and his Heirs, the Clergy, and Commonwealth of the whole Realm, that they intended neither in word nor deed, to offend any State of men in the Realm, but to prevent the approaching Deſtruction of it, and beſeeching all men to favour them and their deſigns, whereof the Firſt was, to Exalt to the Kingdom the true and lawful Heir, and him to Crown in Kingly Throne with the Diadem of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>ALtho' it can no way be doubted, but that His Majeſty's Right and Title to theſe Crowns and Kingdoms, is and was every way Compleat by the Death of His moſt Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Glorious Memory, without the Ceremony and Solemnity of a Proclamation: Yet ſince Proclamations in ſuch Caſes have been always uſed, to the end that all good Subjects might upon this Occaſion teſtify their Duty and Reſpect. And ſince the Armed Violence and other the Calamities of many Years laſt paſt, have hitherto deprived us of any opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein we might expreſs our Loyalty and Allegiance to His Majeſty. We therefore the Lords and Commons now Aſſembled in Parliament, together with the Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Common-Council-Men of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and other Free-Men of this Kingdom now preſent, do according to our Duty and Allegiance, heartily, joyfully, and unanimouſly acknowledge and proclaim, that immediately upon the Deceaſe of our late Sovereign King <hi>Charles</hi> I. the Imperial Crown of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and of all the Kingdoms, Dominions and Rights belonging to the ſame, did by inherent Birth-Right, and lawful undoubted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, deſcend and come to His moſt Excellent Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> II as being lineally, juſtly and lawfully next of the Blood-Royal of this Realm, and that by the Goodneſs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Almighty God, He is of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the moſt Potent, Mighty, and Undoubted King. And thereunto We moſt humbly and faithfully do ſubmit, and oblige our ſelves, our Heirs and Poſterities for ever.</p>

            <p>Beſides the above-recited Libels againſt the State, many Heretical and Socinian Books have been ſeized and ſtopt; particularly one Entitled, <hi>A brief and clear Confutation of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> which was publickly burnt, by Order of both Houſes of Parliament, and the Author proſecuted.

            </p>
            <p>There have been Three Perſons found guilty of High-Treaſon, that were the Printers at ſome of the Private Preſſes above-mention'd, one of which named <hi>William Anderton,</hi> was Condemned and Executed.</p>
            <p>There are Three Preſſes at leaſt, known to be lately remov'd from Public Printing-Houſes in <hi>London</hi> into Private; One from the Houſe of one <hi>Bonny;</hi> another from from one Aſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; and another from one <hi>Andrew Sowle,</hi> all Printers.</p>
            <p>If the Deſign of theſe Perſons who mannage theſe Preſſes were to do Lawful Work, they may do that openly at home, without Hazard or Diſturbance; It muſt therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that they are gone into Private to Libel the Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, Conſidering how abſolutely neceſſary this Act for Printing hath been, and is, for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Common Peace and Good of the Nation, <hi>It is hoped,</hi> That this Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Houſe will continue the ſame, till they ſhall have leiſure to take into their Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the Reaſonableneſs of the Objections that may be made against</hi> the preſent Act, or any Clauſe therein contain'd. <hi>For ſhould this be diſcontinu'd, and the Preſs be but for a while without Reſtraint, His Majeſtie's Government would be left Defenceleſs against His Secret Adverſaries</hi> at Home, <hi>whilst he is hazarding His Royal Perſon</hi> Abroad <hi>against the Common Enemy; the Conſequences of which may prove ſo Fatal, as not to admit of a Future Remedy.</hi>
